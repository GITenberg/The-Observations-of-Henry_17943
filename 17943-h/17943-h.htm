<h2><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>THE
GHOST OF THE MARCHIONESS OF APPLEFORD.</h2>
<p>This is the story, among others, of Henry the waiter&mdash;or, as
he now prefers to call himself, Henri&mdash;told to me in the long dining-room
of the Riffel Alp Hotel, where I once stayed for a melancholy week &ldquo;between
seasons,&rdquo; sharing the echoing emptiness of the place with two
maiden ladies, who talked all day to one another in frightened whispers.&nbsp;
Henry&rsquo;s construction I have discarded for its amateurishness;
his method being generally to commence a story at the end, and then,
working backwards to the beginning, wind up with the middle.&nbsp; But
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>in
all other respects I have endeavoured to retain his method, which was
individual; and this, I think, is the story as he would have told it
to me himself, had he told it in this order:</p>
<p>My first place&mdash;well to be honest, it was a coffee shop in the
Mile End Road&mdash;I&rsquo;m not ashamed of it.&nbsp; We all have our
beginnings.&nbsp; Young &ldquo;Kipper,&rdquo; as we called him&mdash;he
had no name of his own, not that he knew of anyhow, and that seemed
to fit him down to the ground&mdash;had fixed his pitch just outside,
between our door and the music hall at the corner; and sometimes, when
I might happen to have a bit on, I&rsquo;d get a paper from him, and
pay him for it, when the governor was not about, with a mug of coffee,
and odds and ends that <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the
other customers had left on their plates&mdash;an arrangement that suited
both of us.&nbsp; He was just about as sharp as they make boys, even
in the Mile End Road, which is saying a good deal; and now and then,
spying around among the right sort, and keeping his ears open, he would
put me up to a good thing, and I would tip him a bob or a tanner as
the case might be.&nbsp; He was the sort that gets on&mdash;you know.</p>
<p>One day in he walks, for all the world as if the show belonged to
him, with a young imp of a girl on his arm, and down they sits at one
of the tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garsong,&rdquo; he calls out, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the menoo
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The menoo to-day,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;is that you get outside
&rsquo;fore I clip you over the ear, and that you take that back and
put <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>it
where you found it;&rdquo; meaning o&rsquo; course, the kid.</p>
<p>She was a pretty little thing, even then, in spite of the dirt, with
those eyes like saucers, and red hair.&nbsp; It used to be called &ldquo;carrots&rdquo;
in those days.&nbsp; Now all the swells have taken it up&mdash;or as
near as they can get to it&mdash;and it&rsquo;s auburn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Enery,&rdquo; he replied to me, without so much as
turning a hair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re forgetting your
position.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;m on the kerb shouting &lsquo;Speshul!&rsquo;
and you comes to me with yer &rsquo;a&rsquo;penny in yer &rsquo;and,
you&rsquo;re master an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m man.&nbsp; When I comes into
your shop to order refreshments, and to pay for &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;m
boss.&nbsp; Savey?&nbsp; You can bring me a rasher and two eggs, and
see that they&rsquo;re this season&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The lidy will have
a full-sized haddick and a cocoa.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Well,
there was justice in what he said.&nbsp; He always did have sense, and
I took his order.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t often see anybody put it away
like that girl did.&nbsp; I took it she hadn&rsquo;t had a square meal
for many a long day.&nbsp; She polished off a ninepenny haddick, skin
and all, and after that she had two penny rashers, with six slices of
bread and butter&mdash;&ldquo;doorsteps,&rdquo; as we used to call them&mdash;and
two half pints of cocoa, which is a meal in itself the way we used to
make it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; must have had a bit of luck that
day.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t have urged her on more had it been a free
feed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave an egg,&rdquo; he suggested, the moment the rashers
had disappeared.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of these eggs will just about finish
yer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think as I can,&rdquo; says she, after
considering like.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>&ldquo;Well,
you know your own strength,&rdquo; he answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps
you&rsquo;re best without it.&nbsp; Speshully if yer not used to &rsquo;igh
living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was glad to see them finish, &rsquo;cause I was beginning to get
a bit nervous about the coin, but he paid up right enough, and giv me
a ha&rsquo;penny for myself.</p>
<p>That was the first time I ever waited upon those two, but it wasn&rsquo;t
to be the last by many a long chalk, as you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; He often
used to bring her in after that.&nbsp; Who she was and what she was
he didn&rsquo;t know, and she didn&rsquo;t know, so there was a pair
of them.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d run away from an old woman down Limehouse
way, who used to beat her.&nbsp; That was all she could tell him.&nbsp;
He got her a lodging with an old woman, who had an attic in the same
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>house
where he slept&mdash;when it would run to that&mdash;taught her to yell
&ldquo;Speshul!&rdquo; and found a corner for her.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t
room for boys and girls in the Mile-End Road.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re either
kids down there or they&rsquo;re grown-ups.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Carrots&rdquo;&mdash;as we named her&mdash;looked upon themselves
as sweethearts, though he couldn&rsquo;t have been more than fifteen,
and she barely twelve; and that he was regular gone on her anyone could
see with half an eye.&nbsp; Not that he was soft about it&mdash;that
wasn&rsquo;t his style.&nbsp; He kept her in order, and she had just
to mind, which I guess was a good thing for her, and when she wanted
it he&rsquo;d use his hand on her, and make no bones about it.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the way among that class.&nbsp; They up and give the old
woman a friendly clump, just as you or me would swear at <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the
missus, or fling a boot-jack at her.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t mean anything
more.</p>
<p>I left the coffee shop later on for a place in the city, and saw
nothing more of them for five years.&nbsp; When I did it was at a restaurant
in Oxford Street&mdash;one of those amatoor shows run by a lot of women,
who know nothing about the business, and spend the whole day gossiping
and flirting&mdash;&ldquo;love-shops,&rdquo; I call &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
There was a yellow-haired lady manageress who never heard you when you
spoke to her, &rsquo;cause she was always trying to hear what some seedy
old fool would be whispering to her across the counter.&nbsp; Then there
were waitresses, and their notion of waiting was to spend an hour talking
to a twopenny cup of coffee, and to look haughty and insulted whenever
anybody as really wanted something ventured to ask for it.&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>A
frizzle-haired cashier used to make love all day out of her pigeon-hole
with the two box-office boys from the Oxford Music Hall, who took it
turn and turn about.&nbsp; Sometimes she&rsquo;d leave off to take a
customer&rsquo;s money, and sometimes she wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been to some rummy places in my time; and a waiter ain&rsquo;t the blind
owl as he&rsquo;s supposed to be.&nbsp; But never in my life have I
seen so much love-making, not all at once, as used to go on in that
place.&nbsp; It was a dismal, gloomy sort of hole, and spoony couples
seemed to scent it out by instinct, and would spend hours there over
a pot of tea and assorted pastry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Idyllic,&rdquo; some
folks would have thought it: I used to get the fair dismals watching
it.&nbsp; There was one girl&mdash;a weird-looking creature, with red
eyes and long thin hands, that <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>gave
you the creeps to look at.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d come in regular with her
young man, a pale-faced nervous sort of chap, at three o&rsquo;clock
every afternoon.&nbsp; Theirs was the funniest love-making I ever saw.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d pinch him under the table, and run pins into him, and he&rsquo;d
sit with his eyes glued on her as if she&rsquo;d been a steaming dish
of steak and onions and he a starving beggar the other side of the window.&nbsp;
A strange story that was&mdash;as I came to learn it later on.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell you that, one day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been engaged for the &ldquo;heavy work,&rdquo; but as the
heaviest order I ever heard given there was for a cold ham and chicken,
which I had to slip out for to the nearest cook-shop, I must have been
chiefly useful from an ornamental point of view.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>I&rsquo;d
been there about a fortnight, and was feeling pretty sick of it, when
in walked young &ldquo;Kipper.&rdquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know him
at first, he&rsquo;d changed so.&nbsp; He was swinging a silver-mounted
crutch stick, which was the kind that was fashionable just then, and
was dressed in a showy check suit and a white hat.&nbsp; But the thing
that struck me most was his gloves.&nbsp; I suppose I hadn&rsquo;t improved
quite so much myself, for he knew me in a moment, and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, &rsquo;Enery!&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve moved
on, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says, shaking hands with him, &ldquo;and I could
move on again from this shop without feeling sad.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ve
got on a bit?&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-so,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a journalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;what sort?&rdquo; for I&rsquo;d
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>seen
a good many of that lot during six months I&rsquo;d spent at a house
in Fleet Street, and their get-up hadn&rsquo;t sumptuousness about it,
so to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kipper&rsquo;s&rdquo; rig-out must have totted
up to a tidy little sum.&nbsp; He had a diamond pin in his tie that
must have cost somebody fifty quid, if not him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answers, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wind out the
confidential advice to old Beaky, and that sort of thing.&nbsp; I do
the tips, yer know.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Kit,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the Captain Kit?&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; O&rsquo; course
I&rsquo;d heard of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be&rsquo;old!&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; he goes on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some
of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s bound to come out right, and when one does, you
take it from me, our paper mentions the fact.&nbsp; And when it is a
wrong &rsquo;un&mdash;well, a man <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>can&rsquo;t
always be shouting about himself, can &rsquo;e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ordered a cup of coffee.&nbsp; He said he was waiting for someone,
and we got to chatting about old times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Carrots?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Caroline Trevelyan,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is doing
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve found out her fam&rsquo;ly
name, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found out one or two things about that lidy,&rdquo;
he replies.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;yer remember &rsquo;er dancing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen her flinging her petticoats about outside the
shop, when the copper wasn&rsquo;t by, if that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo;
I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean,&rdquo; he answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all the rage now, &lsquo;skirt-dancing&rsquo; they calls it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
a-coming out at the <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Oxford
to-morrow.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s &rsquo;er I&rsquo;m waiting for.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
a-coming on, I tell you she is,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;that was her
disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another thing we&rsquo;ve found out about
&rsquo;er,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; He leant over the table, and whispered
it, as if he was afraid that anybody else might hear: &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
got a voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;some women have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but &rsquo;er voice is the sort
of voice yer want to listen to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s its speciality, is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sonny,&rdquo; he replies.</p>
<p>She came in a little later.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d a&rsquo; known her anywhere
for her eyes, and her red hair, in spite of her being that clean you
might have eaten your dinner out of her <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>hand.&nbsp;
And as for her clothes!&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve mixed a good deal with
the toffs in my time, and I&rsquo;ve seen duchesses dressed more showily
and maybe more expensively, but her clothes seemed to be just a framework
to show her up.&nbsp; She was a beauty, you can take it from me; and
it&rsquo;s not to be wondered that the La-De-Das were round her when
they did see her, like flies round an open jam tart.</p>
<p>Before three months were up she was the rage of London&mdash;leastways
of the music-hall part of it&mdash;with her portrait in all the shop
windows, and interviews with her in half the newspapers.&nbsp; It seems
she was the daughter of an officer who had died in India when she was
a baby, and the niece of a bishop somewhere in Australia.&nbsp; He was
dead too.&nbsp; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any of her ancestry <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>as
wasn&rsquo;t dead, but they had all been swells.&nbsp; She had been
educated privately, she had, by a relative; and had early displayed
an aptitude for dancing, though her friends at first had much opposed
her going upon the stage.&nbsp; There was a lot more of it&mdash;you
know the sort of thing.&nbsp; Of course, she was a connection of one
of our best known judges&mdash;they all are&mdash;and she merely acted
in order to support a grandmother, or an invalid sister, I forget which.&nbsp;
A wonderful talent for swallowing, these newspaper chaps has, some of
&rsquo;em!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; never touched a penny of her money, but if he
had been her agent at twenty-five per cent. he couldn&rsquo;t have worked
harder, and he just kept up the hum about her, till if you didn&rsquo;t
want to hear anything more about Caroline Trevelyan, your only chance
would have <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>been
to lie in bed, and never look at a newspaper.&nbsp; It was Caroline
Trevelyan at Home, Caroline Trevelyan at Brighton, Caroline Trevelyan
and the Shah of Persia, Caroline Trevelyan and the Old Apple-woman.&nbsp;
When it wasn&rsquo;t Caroline Trevelyan herself it would be Caroline
Trevelyan&rsquo;s dog as would be doing something out of the common,
getting himself lost or summoned or drowned&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t matter
much what.</p>
<p>I moved from Oxford Street to the new &ldquo;Horseshoe&rdquo; that
year&mdash;it had just been rebuilt&mdash;and there I saw a good deal
of them, for they came in to lunch there or supper pretty regular.&nbsp;
Young &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo;&mdash;or the &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; as everybody
called him&mdash;gave out that he was her half-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ad to be some sort of a relation, you <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>see,&rdquo;
he explained to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d a&rsquo; been &rsquo;er brother
out and out; that would have been simpler, only the family likeness
wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.&nbsp; Our styles o&rsquo; beauty ain&rsquo;t
similar.&rdquo;&nbsp; They certainly wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you marry her?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and have
done with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked thoughtful at that.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did think of it,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;and I know, jolly well, that if I &rsquo;ad suggested
it &rsquo;fore she&rsquo;d found herself, she&rsquo;d have agreed, but
it don&rsquo;t seem quite fair now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye mean fair?&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not fair to &rsquo;er,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got on all right, in a small way; but she&mdash;well, she can just &rsquo;ave
&rsquo;er pick of the nobs.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one on &rsquo;em as
I&rsquo;ve made inquiries about.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;ll be a dook,
if a kid pegs out as is expected to, and anyhow <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll
be a markis, and &rsquo;e means the straight thing&mdash;no errer.&nbsp;
It ain&rsquo;t fair for me to stand in &rsquo;er way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you know your own business, but
it seems to me she wouldn&rsquo;t have much way to stand in if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
fond enough of the gell, but I shan&rsquo;t clamour for a tombstone
with wiolets, even if she ain&rsquo;t ever Mrs. Capt&rsquo;n Kit.&nbsp;
Business is business; and I ain&rsquo;t going to queer &rsquo;er pitch
for &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered what she&rsquo;d a&rsquo; said, if he&rsquo;d
up and put the case to her plain, for she was a good sort; but, naturally
enough, her head was a bit swelled, and she&rsquo;d read so much rot
about herself in the papers that she&rsquo;d got at last to half believe
some of it.&nbsp; The thought of her <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>connection
with the well-known judge seemed to hamper her at times, and she wasn&rsquo;t
quite so chummy with &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; as used to be the case in
the Mile-End Road days, and he wasn&rsquo;t the sort as is slow to see
a thing.</p>
<p>One day when he was having lunch by himself, and I was waiting on
him, he says, raising his glass to his lips, &ldquo;Well, &rsquo;Enery,
here&rsquo;s luck to yer!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be seeing you agen for
some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;or rather my time is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
off to Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and what about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he interrupts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
fixed up that&mdash;a treat.&nbsp; Truth, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought at first he meant she was going with him.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s going to be the Duchess of Ridingshire with
the kind consent o&rsquo; the kid I spoke about.&nbsp; If not, she&rsquo;ll
be the Marchioness of Appleford.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s doing the square
thing.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s going to be a quiet marriage to-morrow at
the Registry Office, and then I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What need for you to go?&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fancy o&rsquo;
mine.&nbsp; You see, me gone, there&rsquo;s nothing to &rsquo;amper
&rsquo;er&mdash;nothing to interfere with &rsquo;er settling down as
a quiet, respectable toff.&nbsp; With a &rsquo;alf-brother, who&rsquo;s
always got to be spry with some fake about &rsquo;is lineage and &rsquo;is
ancestral estates, and who drops &rsquo;is &lsquo;h&rsquo;s,&rsquo;
complications are sooner or later bound to a-rise.&nbsp; Me out of it&mdash;everything&rsquo;s
simple.&nbsp; Savey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just how it happened.&nbsp; Of course, there was
a big row when the <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>family
heard of it, and a smart lawyer was put up to try and undo the thing.&nbsp;
No expense was spared, you bet; but it was all no go.&nbsp; Nothing
could be found out against her.&nbsp; She just sat tight and said nothing.&nbsp;
So the thing had to stand.&nbsp; They went and lived quietly in the
country and abroad for a year or two, and then folks forgot a bit, and
they came back to London.&nbsp; I often used to see her name in print,
and then the papers always said as how she was charming and graceful
and beautiful, so I suppose the family had made up its mind to get used
to her.</p>
<p>One evening in she comes to the Savoy.&nbsp; My wife put me up to
getting that job, and a good job it is, mind you, when you know your
way about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d never have had the cheek to try for it, if
it hadn&rsquo;t <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>been
for the missis.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a clever one&mdash;she is.&nbsp; I
did a good day&rsquo;s work when I married her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shave off that moustache of yours&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t
an ornament,&rdquo; she says to me, &ldquo;and chance it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
get attempting the lingo.&nbsp; Keep to the broken English, and put
in a shrug or two.&nbsp; You can manage that all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed her tip.&nbsp; Of course the manager saw through me, but
I got in a &ldquo;Oui, monsieur&rdquo; now and again, and they, being
short handed at the time, could not afford to be strict, I suppose.&nbsp;
Anyhow I got took on, and there I stopped for the whole season, and
that was the making of me.</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying, in she comes to the supper rooms, and toffy
enough she looked in her diamonds and furs, and as <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>for
haughtiness there wasn&rsquo;t a born Marchioness she couldn&rsquo;t
have given points to.&nbsp; She comes straight up to my table and sits
down.&nbsp; Her husband was with her, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to have
much to say, except to repeat her orders.&nbsp; Of course I looked as
if I&rsquo;d never set eyes on her before in all my life, though all
the time she was a-pecking at the mayonnaise and a-sipping at the Giessler,
I was thinking of the coffee-shop and of the ninepenny haddick and the
pint of cocoa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and fetch my cloak,&rdquo; she says to him after a while.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And up he gets and goes out.</p>
<p>She never moved her head, and spoke as though she was merely giving
me some order, and I stands behind her chair, respectful like, and answers
according to the same tip,</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>&ldquo;Ever
hear from &lsquo;Kipper&rsquo;?&rdquo; she says to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had one or two letters from him, your ladyship,&rdquo;
I answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stow that,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sick of
&lsquo;your ladyship.&rsquo;&nbsp; Talk English; I don&rsquo;t hear
much of it.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s he getting on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be doing himself well,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
started an hotel, and is regular raking it in, he tells me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I was behind the bar with him!&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t it work then?&rdquo; I asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a funeral with the corpse left out,&rdquo;
says she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Serves me jolly well right for being a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis, he comes back with her cloak at that moment, and I says:
&ldquo;Certainement, madame,&rdquo; and gets clear.</p>
<p>I often used to see her there, and when <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>a
chance occurred she would talk to me.&nbsp; It seemed to be a relief
to her to use her own tongue, but it made me nervous at times for fear
someone would hear her.</p>
<p>Then one day I got a letter from &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; to say he was
over for a holiday and was stopping at Morley&rsquo;s, and asking me
to look him up.</p>
<p>He had not changed much except to get a bit fatter and more prosperous-looking.&nbsp;
Of course, we talked about her ladyship, and I told him what she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum things, women,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;never know their
own minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they know them all right when they get there,&rdquo; I
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could she tell what being a Marchioness was like
till she&rsquo;d tried it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; he says, musing like.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckoned
it the very thing she&rsquo;d tumble <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to.&nbsp;
I only come over to get a sight of &rsquo;er, and to satisfy myself
as she was getting along all right.&nbsp; Seems I&rsquo;d better a&rsquo;
stopped away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t ever thought of marrying yourself?&rdquo;
I asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slow
for a man over thirty with no wife and kids to bustle him, you take
it from me, and I ain&rsquo;t the talent for the Don Juan fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like me,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;a day&rsquo;s
work, and then a pipe by your own fireside with your slippers on.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my swarry.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find someone as will suit
you before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
come across a few as might, if it &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t been for &rsquo;er.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s like the toffs as come out our way.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve been
brought up on &lsquo;ris <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>de
veau &agrave; la financier,&rsquo; and sich like, and it just spoils
&rsquo;em for the bacon and greens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I give her the office the next time I see her, and they met accidental
like in Kensington Gardens early one morning.&nbsp; What they said to
one another I don&rsquo;t know, for he sailed that same evening, and,
it being the end of the season, I didn&rsquo;t see her ladyship again
for a long while.</p>
<p>When I did it was at the H&ocirc;tel Bristol in Paris, and she was
in widow&rsquo;s weeds, the Marquis having died eight months before.&nbsp;
He never dropped into that dukedom, the kid turning out healthier than
was expected, and hanging on; so she was still only a Marchioness, and
her fortune, though tidy, was nothing very big&mdash;not as that class
reckons.&nbsp; By luck <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>I
was told off to wait on her, she having asked for someone as could speak
English.&nbsp; She seemed glad to see me and to talk to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be bossing
that bar in Capetown now before long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk sense,&rdquo; she answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can the Marchioness
of Appleford marry a hotel keeper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if she fancies him?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the good of being a Marchioness if you can&rsquo;t do what you like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; she snaps out; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
It would not be doing the straight thing by the family.&nbsp; No,&rdquo;
she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent their money, and I&rsquo;m spending
it now.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t love me, but they shan&rsquo;t say as
I have disgraced <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>them.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve got their feelings same as I&rsquo;ve got mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not chuck the money?&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
be glad enough to get it back,&rdquo; they being a poor lot, as I heard
her say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a life
interest.&nbsp; As long as I live I&rsquo;ve got to have it, and as
long as I live I&rsquo;ve got to remain the Marchioness of Appleford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She finishes her soup, and pushes the plate away from her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As long as I live,&rdquo; she says, talking to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; she says, starting up &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not what?&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get me an African
telegraph form, and be quick about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fetched it for her, and she wrote it and gave it to the porter
then and there; <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and,
that done, she sat down and finished her dinner.</p>
<p>She was a bit short with me after that; so I judged it best to keep
my own place.</p>
<p>In the morning she got an answer that seemed to excite her, and that
afternoon she left; and the next I heard of her was a paragraph in the
newspaper, headed&mdash;&ldquo;Death of the Marchioness of Appleford.&nbsp;
Sad accident.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed she had gone for a row on one of
the Italian lakes with no one but a boatman.&nbsp; A squall had come
on, and the boat had capsized.&nbsp; The boatman had swum ashore, but
he had been unable to save his passenger, and her body had never been
recovered.&nbsp; The paper reminded its readers that she had formerly
been the celebrated tragic actress, Caroline Trevelyan, daughter of
the well-known Indian judge of that name.</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>It
gave me the blues for a day or two&mdash;that bit of news.&nbsp; I had
known her from a baby as you might say, and had taken an interest in
her.&nbsp; You can call it silly, but hotels and restaurants seemed
to me less interesting now there was no chance of ever seeing her come
into one again.</p>
<p>I went from Paris to one of the smaller hotels in Venice.&nbsp; The
missis thought I&rsquo;d do well to pick up a bit of Italian, and perhaps
she fancied Venice for herself.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of the advantages
of our profession.&nbsp; You can go about.&nbsp; It was a second-rate
sort of place, and one evening, just before lighting-up time, I had
the salle-&agrave;-manger all to myself, and had just taken up a paper
when I hears the door open, and I turns round.</p>
<p>I saw &ldquo;her&rdquo; coming down the room.&nbsp; <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>There
was no mistaking her.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t that sort.</p>
<p>I sat with my eyes coming out of my head till she was close to me,
and then I says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carrots!&rdquo; I says, in a whisper like.&nbsp; That was
the name that come to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Carrots&rsquo; it is,&rdquo; she says, and down she
sits just opposite to me, and then she laughs.</p>
<p>I could not speak, I could not move, I was that took aback, and the
more frightened I looked the more she laughed till &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo;
comes into the room.&nbsp; There was nothing ghostly about him.&nbsp;
I never see a man look more as if he had backed the winner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;Enery,&rdquo; he says; and he gives
me a slap on the back, as knocks the life into me again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you was dead,&rdquo; I says, still <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>staring
at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I read it in the paper&mdash;&lsquo;death of the
Marchioness of Appleford.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Marchioness of Appleford is as dead as a door-nail, and a good job too.&nbsp;
Mrs. Captain Kit&rsquo;s my name, n&eacute;e &lsquo;Carrots.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said as &rsquo;ow I&rsquo;d find someone to suit me &rsquo;fore
long,&rdquo; says &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; to me, &ldquo;and, by Jove! you
were right; I &rsquo;ave.&nbsp; I was waiting till I found something
equal to her ladyship, and I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad to wait a
long time, I&rsquo;m thinking, if I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t come across this
one &rsquo;ere&rdquo;; and he tucks her up under his arm just as I remember
his doing that day he first brought her into the coffee-shop, and Lord,
what a long time ago that was!</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>That is the story, among others, told me by Henry, the waiter.&nbsp;
I have, at his <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>request,
substituted artificial names for real ones.&nbsp; For Henry tells me
that at Capetown Captain Kit&rsquo;s First-class Family and Commercial
Hotel still runs, and that the landlady is still a beautiful woman with
fine eyes and red hair, who might almost be taken for a duchess&mdash;until
she opens her mouth, when her accent is found to be still slightly reminiscent
of the Mile-End Road.</p>
<h2><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>THE
USES AND ABUSES OF JOSEPH.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is just the same with what you may call the human joints,&rdquo;
observed Henry.&nbsp; He was in one of his philosophic moods that evening.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It all depends upon the cooking.&nbsp; I never see a youngster
hanging up in the refrigerator, as one may put it, but I says to myself:
&lsquo;Now I wonder what the cook is going to make of you!&nbsp; Will
you be minced and devilled and fricasseed till you are all sauce and
no meat?&nbsp; Will you be hammered tender and grilled over a slow fire
till you are a blessing to mankind?&nbsp; Or will you be spoilt in the
boiling, and come out a stringy rag, an <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>immediate
curse, and a permanent injury to those who have got to swallow you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a youngster I knew in my old coffee-shop days,&rdquo;
continued Henry, &ldquo;that in the end came to be eaten by cannibals.&nbsp;
At least, so the newspapers said.&nbsp; Speaking for myself, I never
believed the report: he wasn&rsquo;t that sort.&nbsp; If anybody was
eaten, it was more likely the cannibal.&nbsp; But that is neither here
nor there.&nbsp; What I am thinking of is what happened before he and
the cannibals ever got nigh to one another.&nbsp; He was fourteen when
I first set eyes on him&mdash;Mile End fourteen, that is; which is the
same, I take it, as City eighteen and West End five-and-twenty&mdash;and
he was smart for his age into the bargain: a trifle too smart as a matter
of fact.&nbsp; He always came into the shop at the same time&mdash;half-past
two; he <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>always
sat in the seat next the window; and three days out of six, he would
order the same dinner: a fourpenny beef-steak pudding&mdash;we called
it beef-steak, and, for all practical purposes, it was beef-steak&mdash;a
penny plate of potatoes, and a penny slice of roly-poly pudding&mdash;&lsquo;chest
expander&rsquo; was the name our customers gave it&mdash;to follow.&nbsp;
That showed sense, I always thought, that dinner alone; a more satisfying
menu, at the price, I defy any human being to work out.&nbsp; He always
had a book with him, and he generally read during his meal; which is
not a bad plan if you don&rsquo;t want to think too much about what
you are eating.&nbsp; There was a seedy chap, I remember, used to dine
at a cheap restaurant where I once served, just off the Euston Road.&nbsp;
He would stick a book up in front of him&mdash;Eppy something or <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>other&mdash;and
read the whole time.&nbsp; Our four-course shilling table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te
with Eppy, he would say, was a banquet fit for a prince; without Eppy
he was of opinion that a policeman wouldn&rsquo;t touch it.&nbsp; But
he was one of those men that report things for the newspapers, and was
given to exaggeration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coffee-shop becomes a bit of a desert towards three o&rsquo;clock;
and, after a while, young Tidelman, for that was his name, got to putting
down his book and chatting to me.&nbsp; His father was dead; which,
judging from what he told me about the old man, must have been a bit
of luck for everybody; and his mother, it turned out, had come from
my own village in Suffolk; and that constituted a sort of bond between
us, seeing I had known all her people pretty intimately.&nbsp; He was
earning good <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>money
at a dairy, where his work was scouring milk-cans; and his Christian
name&mdash;which was the only thing Christian about him, and that, somehow
or another, didn&rsquo;t seem to fit him&mdash;was Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One afternoon he came into the shop looking as if he had lost
a shilling and found sixpence, as the saying is; and instead of drinking
water as usual, sent the girl out for a pint of ale.&nbsp; The moment
it came he drank off half of it at a gulp, and then sat staring out
of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; I says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Got the
shove?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answers; &lsquo;but, as it happens,
it&rsquo;s a shove up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been taken off the yard and
put on the walk, with a rise of two bob a week.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he
took another pull at the beer and looked more savage than ever.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
I says, &lsquo;that ain&rsquo;t the sort of thing to be humpy about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes it is,&rsquo; he snaps back; &lsquo;it means that
if I don&rsquo;t take precious good care I&rsquo;ll drift into being
a blooming milkman, spending my life yelling &ldquo;Milk ahoi!&rdquo;
and spooning smutty-faced servant-gals across area railings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and what may you prefer to
spoon&mdash;duchesses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answers sulky-like; &lsquo;duchesses
are right enough&mdash;some of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So are servant-gals,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;some of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Your hat&rsquo;s feeling a bit small for you this morning,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hat&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
the world as I&rsquo;m complaining of&mdash;beastly place; there&rsquo;s
nothing to do in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;some of us find there&rsquo;s
a bit too much.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d been up since five <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>that
morning myself; and his own work, which was scouring milk-cans for twelve
hours a day, didn&rsquo;t strike me as suggesting a life of leisured
ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rsquo; he says.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
mean things worth doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what do you want to do,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;that
this world ain&rsquo;t big enough for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t the size of it,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
the dulness of it.&nbsp; Things used to be different in the old days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can read about it,&rsquo; he answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and what do they know about
it&mdash;these gents that sit down and write about it for their living!&nbsp;
You show me a book cracking up the old times, writ by a chap as lived
in &rsquo;em, and I&rsquo;ll believe you.&nbsp; Till then I&rsquo;ll
stick to my opinion <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>that
the old days were much the same as these days, and maybe a trifle worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From a Sunday School point of view, perhaps yes,&rsquo;
says he; &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s no gainsaying&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No what?&rsquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No gainsaying,&rsquo; repeats he; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
a common word in literatoor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but this happens to be
&ldquo;The Blue Posts Coffee House,&rdquo; established in the year 1863.&nbsp;
We will use modern English here, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One had to take him down like that at times.&nbsp; He was the sort of
boy as would talk poetry to you if you weren&rsquo;t firm with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well then, there&rsquo;s no denying the fact,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;if you prefer it that way, that in the old days there
was more opportunity for adventure.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;What
about Australia?&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Australia!&rsquo; retorts he; &lsquo;what would I do
there?&nbsp; Be a shepherd, like you see in the picture, wear ribbons,
and play the flute?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not much of that sort of shepherding
over there,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;unless I&rsquo;ve been deceived; but
if Australia ain&rsquo;t sufficiently uncivilised for you, what about
Africa?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of Africa?&rsquo; replies he;
&lsquo;you don&rsquo;t read advertisements in the &ldquo;Clerkenwell
News&rdquo;: &ldquo;Young men wanted as explorers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
drift into a barber&rsquo;s shop at Cape Town more likely than anything
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What about the gold diggings?&rsquo; I suggests.&nbsp;
I like to see a youngster with the spirit of adventure in him.&nbsp;
It shows grit as a rule.</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Played
out,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are employed by a company, wages
ten dollars a week, and a pension for your old age.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s
played out,&rsquo; he continues.&nbsp; &lsquo;Men ain&rsquo;t wanted
nowadays.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only room for clerks, and intelligent
artisans, and shopboys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go for a soldier,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
excitement for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That would have been all right,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;in
the days when there was real fighting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good bit of it going about nowadays,&rsquo;
I says.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are generally at it, on and off, between shouting
about the blessings of peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not the sort of fighting I mean,&rsquo; replies he;
&lsquo;I want to do something myself, not be one of a row.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I give you up.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
<!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>dropped
into the wrong world it seems to me.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t seem able
to cater for you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come a bit too late,&rsquo; he answers;
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s the mistake I&rsquo;ve made.&nbsp; Two hundred years
ago there were lots of things a fellow might have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I know what&rsquo;s in your mind,&rsquo; I says:
&lsquo;pirates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, pirates would be all right,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;they
got plenty of sea-air and exercise, and didn&rsquo;t need to join a
blooming funeral club.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got ideas above your station,&rsquo; I
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;You work hard, and one day you&rsquo;ll have a milk-shop
of your own, and be walking out with a pretty housemaid on your arm,
feeling as if you were the Prince of Wales himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stow it!&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;it makes me <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>shiver
for fear it might come true.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not cut out for a respectable
cove, and I won&rsquo;t be one neither, if I can help it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean to be, then?&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve
all got to be something, until we&rsquo;re stiff &rsquo;uns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he says, quite cool-like, &lsquo;I think
I shall be a burglar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped into the seat opposite and stared at him.&nbsp;
If any other lad had said it I should have known it was only foolishness,
but he was just the sort to mean it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only calling I can think of,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;that has got any element of excitement left in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You call seven years at Portland &ldquo;excitement,&rdquo;
do you?&rsquo; says I, thinking of the argument most likely to tell
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the difference,&rsquo; answers he, <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>&lsquo;between
Portland and the ordinary labouring man&rsquo;s life, except that at
Portland you never need fear being out of work?&rsquo;&nbsp; He was
a rare one to argue.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
only the fools as gets copped.&nbsp; Look at that diamond robbery in
Bond Street, two years ago.&nbsp; Fifty thousand pounds&rsquo; worth
of jewels stolen, and never a clue to this day!&nbsp; Look at the Dublin
Bank robbery,&rsquo; says he, his eyes all alight, and his face flushed
like a girl&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &lsquo;Three thousand pounds in golden sovereigns
walked away with in broad daylight, and never so much as the flick of
a coat-tail seen.&nbsp; Those are the sort of men I&rsquo;m thinking
of, not the bricklayer out of work, who smashes a window and gets ten
years for breaking open a cheesemonger&rsquo;s till with nine and fourpence
ha&rsquo;penny in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
says I, &lsquo;and are you forgetting the chap who was nabbed at Birmingham
only last week?&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t exactly an amatoor.&nbsp; How
long do think he&rsquo;ll get?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A man like that deserves what he gets,&rsquo; answers
he; &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t hit a police-man at six yards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You bloodthirsty young scoundrel,&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;do
you mean you wouldn&rsquo;t stick at murder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all in the game,&rsquo; says he, not in
the least put out.&nbsp; &lsquo;I take my risks, he takes his.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no more murder than soldiering is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s taking a human creature&rsquo;s life,&rsquo;
I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;what of it?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
plenty more where he comes from.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried reasoning with him from time to time, but he wasn&rsquo;t
a sort of boy to <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>be
moved from a purpose.&nbsp; His mother was the only argument that had
any weight with him.&nbsp; I believe so long as she had lived he would
have kept straight; that was the only soft spot in him.&nbsp; But unfortunately
she died a couple of years later, and then I lost sight of Joe altogether.&nbsp;
I made enquiries, but no one could tell me anything.&nbsp; He had just
disappeared, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One afternoon, four years later, I was sitting in the coffee-room
of a City restaurant where I was working, reading the account of a clever
robbery committed the day before.&nbsp; The thief, described as a well-dressed
young man of gentlemanly appearance, wearing a short black beard and
moustache, had walked into a branch of the London and Westminster Bank
during the dinner-hour, when only the <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>manager
and one clerk were there.&nbsp; He had gone straight through to the
manager&rsquo;s room at the back of the bank, taken the key from the
inside of the door, and before the man could get round his desk had
locked him in.&nbsp; The clerk, with a knife to his throat, had then
been persuaded to empty all the loose cash in the bank, amounting in
gold and notes to nearly five hundred pounds, into a bag which the thief
had thoughtfully brought with him.&nbsp; After which, both of them&mdash;for
the thief seems to have been of a sociable disposition&mdash;got into
a cab which was waiting outside, and drove away.&nbsp; They drove straight
to the City: the clerk, with a knife pricking the back of his neck all
the time, finding it, no doubt, a tiresome ride.&nbsp; In the middle
of Threadneedle Street, the gentlemanly young man suddenly stopped <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the
cab and got out, leaving the clerk to pay the cabman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow or other, the story brought back Joseph to my mind.&nbsp;
I seemed to see him as that well-dressed gentlemanly young man; and,
raising my eyes from the paper, there he stood before me.&nbsp; He had
scarcely changed at all since I last saw him, except that he had grown
better looking, and seemed more cheerful.&nbsp; He nodded to me as though
we had parted the day before, and ordered a chop and a small hock.&nbsp;
I spread a fresh serviette for him, and asked him if he cared to see
the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anything interesting in it, Henry?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rather a daring robbery committed on the Westminster
Bank yesterday,&rsquo; I answers.</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,
ah!&nbsp; I did see something about that,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The thief was described as a well-dressed young man
of gentlemanly appearance, wearing a black beard and moustache,&rsquo;
says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughs pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That will make it awkward for nice young men with black
beards and moustaches,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fortunately for you
and me, we&rsquo;re clean shaved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt as certain he was the man as though I&rsquo;d seen
him do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gives me a sharp glance, but I was busy with the cruets,
and he had to make what he chose out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replies, &lsquo;as you say, it was a
daring robbery.&nbsp; But the man seems to have got away all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>&ldquo;I
could see he was dying to talk to somebody about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s all right to-day,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;but
the police ain&rsquo;t the fools they&rsquo;re reckoned.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
noticed they generally get there in the end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s some very intelligent men among them,&rsquo;
says he: &lsquo;no question of it.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if they had a clue!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;no more should I; though
no doubt he&rsquo;s telling himself there never was such a clever thief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, we shall see,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We talked a bit about old acquaintances and other things,
and then, having finished, he handed me a sovereign and rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;your bill <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>comes
to three-and-eight.&nbsp; Say fourpence for the waiter; that leaves
sixteen shillings change, which I&rsquo;ll ask you to put in your pocket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you will,&rsquo; he says, laughing, though I could
see he didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And one other thing,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve
been sort of pals, and it&rsquo;s not my business to talk unless I&rsquo;m
spoken to.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m a married man,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and
I don&rsquo;t consider you the sort worth getting into trouble for.&nbsp;
If I never see you, I know nothing about you.&nbsp; Understand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took my tip, and I didn&rsquo;t see him again at that restaurant.&nbsp;
I kept my eye on the paper, but the Westminster Bank thief was never
discovered, and success, no doubt, gave him confidence.&nbsp; Anyhow,
I read of two or three burglaries that winter which I unhesitatingly
put down <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>to
Mr. Joseph&mdash;I suppose there&rsquo;s style in housebreaking, as
in other things&mdash;and early the next spring an exciting bit of business
occurred, which I knew to be his work by the description of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had broken into a big country house during the servants&rsquo;
supper-hour, and had stuffed his pockets with jewels.&nbsp; One of the
guests, a young officer, coming upstairs, interrupted him just as he
had finished.&nbsp; Joseph threatened the man with his revolver; but
this time it was not a nervous young clerk he had to deal with.&nbsp;
The man sprang at him, and a desperate struggle followed, with the result
that in the end the officer was left with a bullet in his leg, while
Joseph jumped clean through the window, and fell thirty feet.&nbsp;
Cut and bleeding, if not broken, he would <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>never
have got away but that, fortunately for him, a tradesman&rsquo;s cart
happened to be standing at the servants&rsquo; entrance.&nbsp; Joe was
in it, and off like a flash of greased lightning.&nbsp; How he managed
to escape, with all the country in an uproar, I can&rsquo;t tell you;
but he did it.&nbsp; The horse and cart, when found sixteen miles off,
were neither worth much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, it seems, sobered him down for a bit, and nobody heard
any more of him till nine months later, when he walked into the Monico,
where I was then working, and held out his hand to me as bold as brass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
the hand of an honest man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s come into your possession very recently
then,&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dressed in a black frock-coat <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and
wore whiskers.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t known him, I should have put
him down for a parson out of work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughs.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rsquo;
he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not here,&rsquo; I answers, &lsquo;because I&rsquo;m
too busy; but if you like to meet me this evening, and you&rsquo;re
talking straight&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Straight as a bullet,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
and have a bit of dinner with me at the Craven; it&rsquo;s quiet there,
and we can talk.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for the last
week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I met him; and he told me.&nbsp; It was the old story:
a gal was at the bottom of it.&nbsp; He had broken into a small house
at Hampstead.&nbsp; He was on the floor, packing up the silver, when
the door opens, and he sees a gal standing there.&nbsp; <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>She
held a candle in one hand and a revolver in the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Put your hands up above your head,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I looked at the revolver,&rsquo; said Joe, telling
me; &lsquo;it was about eighteen inches off my nose; and then I looked
at the gal.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots of &rsquo;em will threaten to blow
your brains out for you, but you&rsquo;ve only got to look at &rsquo;em
to know they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are thinking of the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, and
wondering how the judge will sum up.&nbsp; She met my eyes, and I held
up my hands.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t have been here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now you go in front,&rsquo; says she to Joe, and he
went.&nbsp; She laid her candle down in the hall and unbolted the front
door.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;What
are you going to do?&rsquo; says Joe, &lsquo;call the police?&nbsp;
Because if so, my dear, I&rsquo;ll take my chance of that revolver being
loaded and of your pulling the trigger in time.&nbsp; It will be a more
dignified ending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;I had a brother that got
seven years for forgery.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to think of another
face like his when he came out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to see you outside
my master&rsquo;s house, and that&rsquo;s all I care about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went down the garden-path with him, and opened the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You turn round,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;before you
reach the bottom of the lane and I give the alarm.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
Joe went straight, and didn&rsquo;t look behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a rum beginning to a courtship, but the end was
rummer.&nbsp; The girl <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>was
willing to marry him if he would turn honest.&nbsp; Joe wanted to turn
honest, but didn&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use fixing me down, my dear, to any quiet,
respectable calling,&rsquo; says Joe to the gal, &lsquo;because, even
if the police would let me alone, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stop there.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d break out, sooner or later, try as I might.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl went to her master, who seems to have been an odd
sort of a cove, and told him the whole story.&nbsp; The old gent said
he&rsquo;d see Joe, and Joe called on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your religion?&rsquo; says the old gent
to Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not particular, sir; I&rsquo;ll leave it
to you,&rsquo; says Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; says the old gent.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
no fanatic.&nbsp; What are your principles?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>&ldquo;At
first Joe didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d got any, but, the old gent leading,
he found to his surprise as he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; says Joe, &lsquo;in doing a job thoroughly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What your hand finds to do, you believe in doing with
all your might, eh?&rsquo; says the old gent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir,&rsquo; says Joe.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;ve always tried to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anything else?&rsquo; asks the old gent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; stick to your pals,&rsquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Through thick and thin,&rsquo; suggests the old gent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To the blooming end,&rsquo; agrees Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; says the old gent.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Faithful unto death.&nbsp; And you really want to turn over a
new leaf&mdash;to put your wits and your energy and your courage to
good use instead of bad?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s
the idea,&rsquo; says Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gent murmurs something to himself about a stone which
the builders wouldn&rsquo;t have at any price; and then he turns and
puts it straight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you undertake the work,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll
go through with it without faltering&mdash;you&rsquo;ll devote your
life to it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I undertake the job, I&rsquo;ll do that,&rsquo;
says Joe.&nbsp; &lsquo;What may it be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To go to Africa,&rsquo; says the old gent, &lsquo;as
a missionary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe sits down and stares at the old gent, and the old gent
looks him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a dangerous station,&rsquo; says the old
gent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two of our people have lost their lives there.&nbsp;
It wants a man there&mdash;a man who will do something besides preach,
who will save these poor people we have gathered together there <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>from
being scattered and lost, who will be their champion, their protector,
their friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the end, Joe took on the job, and went out with his wife.&nbsp;
A better missionary that Society never had and never wanted.&nbsp; I
read one of his early reports home; and if the others were anything
like it his life must have been exciting enough, even for him.&nbsp;
His station was a small island of civilisation, as one may say, in the
middle of a sea of savages.&nbsp; Before he had been there a month the
place had been attacked twice.&nbsp; On the first occasion Joe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;flock&rsquo; had crowded into the Mission House, and commenced
to pray, that having been the plan of defence adopted by his predecessor.&nbsp;
Joe cut the prayer short, and preached to them from the text, &lsquo;Heaven
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>helps
them as helps themselves&rsquo;; after which he proceeded to deal out
axes and old rifles.&nbsp; In his report he mentioned that he had taken
a hand himself, merely as an example to the flock; I bet he had never
enjoyed an evening more in all his life.&nbsp; The second fight began,
as usual, round the Mission, but seems to have ended two miles off.&nbsp;
In less than six months he had rebuilt the school-house, organised a
police force, converted all that was left of one tribe, and started
a tin church.&nbsp; He added (but I don&rsquo;t think they read that
part of his report aloud) that law and order was going to be respected,
and life and property secure in his district so long as he had a bullet
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on the Society sent him still further inland, to open
up a fresh station; <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>and
there it was that, according to the newspapers, the cannibals got hold
of him and ate him.&nbsp; As I said, personally I don&rsquo;t believe
it.&nbsp; One of these days he&rsquo;ll turn up, sound and whole; he
is that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>THE
SURPRISE OF MR. MILBERRY.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the sort of thing to tell &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
remarked Henry, as, with his napkin over his arm, he leant against one
of the pillars of the verandah, and sipped the glass of Burgundy I had
poured out for him; &ldquo;and they wouldn&rsquo;t believe it if you
did tell &rsquo;em, not one of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s the truth,
for all that.&nbsp; Without the clothes they couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t believe what?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; He
had a curious habit, had Henry, of commenting aloud upon his own unspoken
thoughts, thereby bestowing upon his conversation much of the quality
of the double <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>acrostic.&nbsp;
We had been discussing the question whether sardines served their purpose
better as a hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre or as a savoury; and I found myself
wondering for the moment why sardines, above all other fish, should
be of an unbelieving nature; while endeavouring to picture to myself
the costume best adapted to display the somewhat difficult figure of
a sardine.&nbsp; Henry put down his glass, and came to my rescue with
the necessary explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, women&mdash;that they can tell one baby from another,
without its clothes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a sister, a monthly nurse,
and she will tell you for a fact, if you care to ask her, that up to
three months of age there isn&rsquo;t really any difference between
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; You can tell a girl from a boy and a Christian child
from a black heathen, <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>perhaps;
but to fancy you can put your finger on an unclothed infant and say:
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a Smith, or that&rsquo;s a Jones,&rsquo; as the
case may be&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s sheer nonsense.&nbsp; Take the things
off &rsquo;em, and shake them up in a blanket, and I&rsquo;ll bet you
what you like that which is which you&rsquo;d never be able to tell
again so long as you lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agreed with Henry, so far as my own personal powers of discrimination
might be concerned, but I suggested that to Mrs. Jones or Mrs. Smith
there would surely occur some means of identification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;d tell you themselves, no doubt,&rdquo; replied
Henry; &ldquo;and of course, I am not thinking of cases where the child
might have a mole or a squint, as might come in useful.&nbsp; But take
&rsquo;em in general, kids are as much alike as sardines of the same
age would be.&nbsp; Anyhow, I knew a <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>case
where a fool of a young nurse mixed up two children at an hotel, and
to this day neither of those women is sure that she&rsquo;s got her
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there was no possible means
of distinguishing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a flea-bite to go by,&rdquo; answered Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They had the same bumps, the same pimples, the same scratches;
they were the same age to within three days; they weighed the same to
an ounce; and they measured the same to an inch.&nbsp; One father was
tall and fair, and the other was short and dark.&nbsp; The tall, fair
man had a dark, short wife; and the short, dark man had married a tall,
fair woman.&nbsp; For a week they changed those kids to and fro a dozen
times a day, and cried and quarrelled over them.&nbsp; Each woman felt
sure she was the mother of the <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>one
that was crowing at the moment, and when it yelled she was positive
it was no child of hers.&nbsp; They thought they would trust to the
instinct of the children.&nbsp; Neither child, so long as it wasn&rsquo;t
hungry, appeared to care a curse for anybody; and when it was hungry
it always wanted the mother that the other kid had got.&nbsp; They decided,
in the end, to leave it to time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s three years ago now,
and possibly enough some likeness to the parents will develop that will
settle the question.&nbsp; All I say is, up to three months old you
can&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em, I don&rsquo;t care who says you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and appeared to be absorbed in contemplation of the distant
Matterhorn, then clad in its rosy robe of evening.&nbsp; There was a
vein of poetry in Henry, not uncommon among cooks and waiters.&nbsp;
<!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>The
perpetual atmosphere of hot food I am inclined to think favourable to
the growth of the softer emotions.&nbsp; One of the most sentimental
men I ever knew kept a ham-and-beef shop just off the Farringdon Road.&nbsp;
In the early morning he could be shrewd and business-like, but when
hovering with a knife and fork above the mingled steam of bubbling sausages
and hissing peas-pudding, any whimpering tramp with any impossible tale
of woe could impose upon him easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rummiest go I ever recollect in connection with a
baby,&rdquo; continued Henry after a while, his gaze still fixed upon
the distant snow-crowned peaks, &ldquo;happened to me at Warwick in
the Jubilee year.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a proper story,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;a story fit for
me to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>On
consideration, Henry saw no harm in it, and told it to me accordingly.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>He came by the &rsquo;bus that meets the 4.52.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d a
handbag and a sort of hamper: it looked to me like a linen-basket.&nbsp;
He wouldn&rsquo;t let the Boots touch the hamper, but carried it up
into his bedroom himself.&nbsp; He carried it in front of him by the
handles, and grazed his knuckles at every second step.&nbsp; He slipped
going round the bend of the stairs, and knocked his head a rattling
good thump against the balustrade; but he never let go that hamper&mdash;only
swore and plunged on.&nbsp; I could see he was nervous and excited,
but one gets used to nervous and excited people in hotels.&nbsp; Whether
a man&rsquo;s running away from a thing, or running after a thing, he
stops at a hotel on his way; and <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>so
long as he looks as if he could pay his bill one doesn&rsquo;t trouble
much about him.&nbsp; But this man interested me: he was so uncommonly
young and innocent-looking.&nbsp; Besides, it was a dull hole of a place
after the sort of jobs I&rsquo;d been used to; and when you&rsquo;ve
been doing nothing for three months but waiting on commercial gents
as are having an exceptionally bad season, and spoony couples with guide-books,
you get a bit depressed, and welcome any incident, however slight, that
promises to be out of the common.</p>
<p>I followed him up into his room, and asked him if I could do anything
for him.&nbsp; He flopped the hamper on the bed with a sigh of relief,
took off his hat, wiped his head with his handkerchief, and then turned
to answer me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a married man?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>It
was an odd question to put to a waiter, but coming from a gent there
was nothing to be alarmed about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; I says&mdash;I was only engaged
at that time, and that not to my wife, if you understand what I mean&mdash;&ldquo;but
I know a good deal about it,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and if it&rsquo;s
a matter of advice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; he answers, interrupting me; &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t want you to laugh at me.&nbsp; I thought if you were a
married man you would be able to understand the thing better.&nbsp;
Have you got an intelligent woman in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got women,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to their
intelligence, that&rsquo;s a matter of opinion; they&rsquo;re the average
sort of women.&nbsp; Shall I call the chambermaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, do,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo;
he says; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll open it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>He
began to fumble with the cord, then he suddenly lets go and begins to
chuckle to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you open it.&nbsp; Open it carefully;
it will surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take much stock in surprises myself.&nbsp; My experience
is that they&rsquo;re mostly unpleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see if you open it,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;it
won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And off he goes again, chuckling
to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says to myself, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re
a harmless specimen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then an idea struck me, and I stopped
with the knot in my fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a corpse,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned as white as the sheet on the bed, and clutched the mantlepiece.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good God! don&rsquo;t suggest such a thing,&rdquo; he <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>says;
&ldquo;I never thought of that.&nbsp; Open it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you came and opened it yourself, sir,&rdquo;
I says.&nbsp; I was beginning not to half like the business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;after that suggestion
of yours&mdash;you&rsquo;ve put me all in a tremble.&nbsp; Open it quick,
man; tell me it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, my own curiosity helped me.&nbsp; I cut the cord, threw open
the lid, and looked in.&nbsp; He kept his eyes turned away, as if he
were frightened to look for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it all right?&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about as alive,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;as anybody&rsquo;ll
ever want it to be, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it breathing all right?&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t hear it breathing,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;re deaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You might have heard its breathing outside <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>in
the street.&nbsp; He listened, and even he was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; he says, and down he plumped in the easy-chair
by the fireplace.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know, I never thought of that,&rdquo;
he goes on.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been shut up in that basket for
over an hour, and if by any chance he&rsquo;d managed to get his head
entangled in the clothes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never do such a fool&rsquo;s
trick again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fond of it?&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>He looked round at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fond of it,&rdquo; he repeats.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m his father.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he begins to
laugh again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I presume I have the
pleasure of addressing Mr. Coster King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coster King?&rdquo; he answers in surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
name&rsquo;s Milberry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I says: &ldquo;The father of this child, according <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>to
the label inside the cover, is Coster King out of Starlight, his mother
being Jenny Deans out of Darby the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looks at me in a nervous fashion, and puts the chair between us.&nbsp;
It was evidently his turn to think as how I was mad.&nbsp; Satisfying
himself, I suppose, that at all events I wasn&rsquo;t dangerous, he
crept closer till he could get a look inside the basket.&nbsp; I never
heard a man give such an unearthly yell in all my life.&nbsp; He stood
on one side of the bed and I on the other.&nbsp; The dog, awakened by
the noise, sat up and grinned, first at one of us and then at the other.&nbsp;
I took it to be a bull-pup of about nine months old, and a fine specimen
for its age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; he shrieks, with his eyes starting out of
his head, &ldquo;That thing <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>isn&rsquo;t
my child.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s happened?&nbsp; Am I going mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on that way,&rdquo; I says, and so he was.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;what did you expect to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he shrieks again; &ldquo;my only child&mdash;my
baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a real child?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;a human child?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Some folks have such a silly way of talking about their dogs&mdash;you
never can tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;the prettiest child
you ever saw in all your life, just thirteen weeks old on Sunday.&nbsp;
He cut his first tooth yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of the dog&rsquo;s face seemed to madden him.&nbsp; He
flung himself upon the basket, and would, I believe, have strangled
the poor beast if I hadn&rsquo;t interposed between them.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
the dog&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;I daresay he&rsquo;s as
sick about the whole business as you are.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s lost, too.&nbsp;
Somebody&rsquo;s been having a lark with you.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve took
your baby out and put this in&mdash;that is, if there ever was a baby
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll excuse me,
gentlemen in their sober senses don&rsquo;t take their babies about
in dog-baskets.&nbsp; Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Banbury,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well known
in Banbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can quite believe it,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
the sort of young man that would be known anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mr. Milberry,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the grocer,
in the High Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you doing here with this dog?&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
irritate me,&rdquo; he answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t
know myself.&nbsp; My wife&rsquo;s stopping here at Warwick, nursing
her mother, and in every letter she&rsquo;s written home for the last
fortnight she&rsquo;s said, &lsquo;Oh, how I do long to see Eric!&nbsp;
If only I could see Eric for a moment!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very motherly sentiment,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;which does
her credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this afternoon,&rdquo; continues he, &ldquo;it being early-closing
day, I thought I&rsquo;d bring the child here, so that she might see
it, and see that it was all right.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t leave her mother
for more than about an hour, and I can&rsquo;t go up to the house, because
the old lady doesn&rsquo;t like me, and I excite her.&nbsp; I wish to
wait here, and Milly&mdash;that&rsquo;s my wife&mdash;was to come to
me when she could get away.&nbsp; I meant this to be a surprise to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>&ldquo;And
I guess,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;it will be the biggest one you have ever
given her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to be funny about it,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not altogether myself, and I may do you an injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t a subject for joking, though
it had its humorous side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;put it in a dog-basket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a dog-basket,&rdquo; he answers irritably;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a picnic hamper.&nbsp; At the last moment I found
I hadn&rsquo;t got the face to carry the child in my arms: I thought
of what the street-boys would call out after me.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
rare one to sleep, and I thought if I made him comfortable in that he
couldn&rsquo;t hurt, just for so short a journey.&nbsp; I took it in
the carriage with me, and carried it on my knees; I haven&rsquo;t let
it out of my hands a blessed moment.&nbsp; <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>It&rsquo;s
witchcraft, that&rsquo;s what it is.&nbsp; I shall believe in the devil
after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
some explanation; it only wants finding.&nbsp; You are sure this is
the identical hamper you packed the child in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was calmer now.&nbsp; He leant over and examined it carefully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t swear
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you never let it go out
of your hands.&nbsp; Now think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been on my knees all
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;unless you
packed the dog yourself in mistake for your baby.&nbsp; Now think it
over quietly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not your wife, I&rsquo;m only trying to
help you.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t say anything even if you did take your
eyes off the thing for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought again, and a light broke over <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp;
I did put it down for a moment on the platform at Banbury while I bought
a &lsquo;Tit-Bits.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;now you&rsquo;re talking
sense.&nbsp; And wait a minute; isn&rsquo;t to-morrow the first day
of the Birmingham Dog Show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting warm,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
a coincidence this dog was being taken to Birmingham, packed in a hamper
exactly similar to the one you put your baby in.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
got this man&rsquo;s bull-pup, he&rsquo;s got your baby; and I wouldn&rsquo;t
like to say off-hand at this moment which of you&rsquo;s feeling the
madder.&nbsp; As likely as not, he thinks you&rsquo;ve done it on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leant his head against the bed-post and groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Milly
may be here at any <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>moment,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll have to tell her the baby&rsquo;s been
sent by mistake to a Dog Show!&nbsp; I daresn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;I daresn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on to Birmingham,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and try and find
it.&nbsp; You can catch the quarter to six and be back here before eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good man,
come with me.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t fit to go by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right; he&rsquo;d have got run over outside the door, the
state he was in then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if the guv&rsquo;nor don&rsquo;t
object&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he won&rsquo;t, he can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cries the young
fellow, wringing his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him it&rsquo;s a matter
of a life&rsquo;s happiness.&nbsp; Tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him it&rsquo;s a matter of half <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>sovereign
extra on to the bill,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll more
likely do the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it did, with the result that in another twenty minutes me
and young Milberry and the bull-pup in its hamper were in a third-class
carriage on our way to Birmingham.&nbsp; Then the difficulties of the
chase began to occur to me.&nbsp; Suppose by luck I was right; suppose
the pup was booked for the Birmingham Dog Show; and suppose by a bit
more luck a gent with a hamper answering description had been noticed
getting out of the 5.13 train; then where were we?&nbsp; We might have
to interview every cabman in the town.&nbsp; As likely as not, by the
time we did find the kid, it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the trouble of
unpacking.&nbsp; Still, it wasn&rsquo;t my cue to blab my thoughts.&nbsp;
The father, poor fellow, was feeling, I take it, just about as bad as
<!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>he
wanted to feel.&nbsp; My business was to put hope into him; so when
he asked me for about the twentieth time if I thought as he would ever
see his child alive again, I snapped him up shortish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret yourself about that,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see a good deal of that child before you&rsquo;ve
done with it.&nbsp; Babies ain&rsquo;t the sort of things as gets lost
easily.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only on the stage that folks ever have any
particular use for other people&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known
some bad characters in my time, but I&rsquo;d have trusted the worst
of &rsquo;em with a wagon-load of other people&rsquo;s kids.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you flatter yourself you&rsquo;re going to lose it!&nbsp; Whoever&rsquo;s
got it, you take it from me, his idea is to do the honest thing, and
never rest till he&rsquo;s succeeded in returning it to the rightful
owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Well,
my talking like that cheered him, and when we reached Birmingham he
was easier.&nbsp; We tackled the station-master, and he tackled all
the porters who could have been about the platform when the 5.13 came
in.&nbsp; All of &rsquo;em agreed that no gent got out of that train
carrying a hamper.&nbsp; The station-master was a family man himself,
and when we explained the case to him he sympathised and telegraphed
to Banbury.&nbsp; The booking-clerk at Banbury remembered only three
gents booking by that particular train.&nbsp; One had been Mr. Jessop,
the corn-chandler; the second was a stranger, who had booked to Wolverhampton;
and the third had been young Milberry himself.&nbsp; The business began
to look hopeless, when one of Smith&rsquo;s newsboys, who was hanging
around, struck in:</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>&ldquo;I
see an old lady,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;hovering about outside the station,
and a-hailing cabs, and she had a hamper with her as was as like that
one there as two peas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought young Milberry would have fallen upon the boy&rsquo;s neck
and kissed him.&nbsp; With the boy to help us, we started among the
cabmen.&nbsp; Old ladies with dog-baskets ain&rsquo;t so difficult to
trace.&nbsp; She had gone to a small second-rate hotel in the Aston
Road.&nbsp; I heard all particulars from the chambermaid, and the old
girl seems to have had as bad a time in her way as my gent had in his.&nbsp;
They couldn&rsquo;t get the hamper into the cab, it had to go on the
top.&nbsp; The old lady was very worried, as it was raining at the time,
and she made the cabman cover it with his apron.&nbsp; Getting it off
the cab they dropped the whole <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>thing
in the road; that woke the child up, and it began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Ma&rsquo;am! what is it?&rdquo; asks the chambermaid,
&ldquo;a baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, it&rsquo;s my baby,&rdquo; answers the old lady,
who seems to have been a cheerful sort of old soul&mdash;leastways,
she was cheerful up to then.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor dear, I hope they haven&rsquo;t
hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady had ordered a room with a fire in it.&nbsp; The Boots
took the hamper up, and laid it on the hearthrug.&nbsp; The old lady
said she and the chambermaid would see to it, and turned him out.&nbsp;
By this time, according to the girl&rsquo;s account, it was roaring
like a steam-siren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty dear!&rdquo; says the old lady, fumbling with the cord,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry; mother&rsquo;s opening it as fast as she can.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then she turns to the chambermaid&mdash;&ldquo;If <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>you
open my bag,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you will find a bottle of milk
and some dog-biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog-biscuits!&rdquo; says the chambermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the old lady, laughing, &ldquo;my baby loves
dog-biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl opened the bag, and there, sure enough, was a bottle of
milk and half a dozen Spratt&rsquo;s biscuits.&nbsp; She had her back
to the old lady, when she heard a sort of a groan and a thud as made
her turn round.&nbsp; The old lady was lying stretched dead on the hearthrug&mdash;so
the chambermaid thought.&nbsp; The kid was sitting up in the hamper
yelling the roof off.&nbsp; In her excitement, not knowing what she
was doing, she handed it a biscuit, which it snatched at greedily and
began sucking.</p>
<p>Then she set to work to slap the old lady back to life again.&nbsp;
In about a minute the <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>poor
old soul opened her eyes and looked round.&nbsp; The baby was quiet
now, gnawing the dog-biscuit.&nbsp; The old lady looked at the child,
then turned and hid her face against the chambermaid&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she says, speaking in an awed voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The thing in the hamper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a baby, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it ain&rsquo;t a dog?&rdquo; says the old
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl began to feel nervous, and to wish that she wasn&rsquo;t
alone with the old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t likely to mistake a dog for a baby, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
says the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a child&mdash;a human infant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady began to cry softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a judgment
on me,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used to talk to that dog as if
it had been a Christian, and now this thing has happened as a punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
happened?&rdquo; says the chambermaid, who was naturally enough growing
more and more curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; says the old lady, sitting up on
the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t a dream, and if I ain&rsquo;t
mad, I started from my home at Farthinghoe, two hours ago, with a one-year-old
bulldog packed in that hamper.&nbsp; You saw me open it; you see what&rsquo;s
inside it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But bulldogs,&rdquo; says the chambermaid, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t
changed into babies by magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; says the old
lady, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see that it matters.&nbsp; I know I started
with a bulldog, and somehow or other it&rsquo;s got turned into that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s put it there,&rdquo; says the chambermaid;
&ldquo;somebody as wanted to get rid of a child.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
took your dog out and put that in its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>&ldquo;They
must have been precious smart,&rdquo; says the old lady; &ldquo;the
hamper hasn&rsquo;t been out of my sight for more than five minutes,
when I went into the refreshment-room at Banbury for a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when they did it,&rdquo; says the chambermaid,
&ldquo;and a clever trick it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady suddenly grasped her position, and jumped up from the
floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;And a nice thing for me,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An unmarried woman in a scandal-mongering village!&nbsp; This
is awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine-looking child,&rdquo; says the chambermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like it?&rdquo; says the old lady.</p>
<p>The chambermaid said she wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The old lady sat down
and tried to think, and the more she thought the worse she felt.&nbsp;
The chambermaid was positive that if we hadn&rsquo;t come when we did
the poor <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>creature
would have gone mad.&nbsp; When the Boots appeared at the door to say
there was a gent and a bulldog downstairs enquiring after a baby, she
flung her arms round the man&rsquo;s neck and hugged him.</p>
<p>We just caught the train to Warwick, and by luck got back to the
hotel ten minutes before the mother turned up.&nbsp; Young Milberry
carried the child in his arms all the way.&nbsp; He said I could have
the hamper for myself, and gave me half-a-sovereign extra on the understanding
that I kept my mouth shut, which I did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he ever told the child&rsquo;s mother what had
happened&mdash;leastways, if he wasn&rsquo;t a fool right through, he
didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>THE
PROBATION OF JAMES WRENCH.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There are two sorts of men as gets hen-pecked,&rdquo; remarked
Henry&mdash;I forgot how the subject had originated, but we had been
discussing the merits of Henry VIII., considered as a father and a husband,&mdash;&ldquo;the
sort as likes it and the sort as don&rsquo;t, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be
too cocksure that the sort as does isn&rsquo;t on the whole in the majority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Henry argumentatively, &ldquo;it
gives, as it were, a kind of interest to life which nowadays, with everything
going smoothly, and no chance of a row anywhere except in your own <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>house,
is apt to become a bit monotonous.&nbsp; There was a chap I got to know
pretty well one winter when I was working in Dresden at the Europ&auml;ischer
Hof: a quiet, meek little man he was, a journeyman butcher by trade;
and his wife was a dressmaker, a Schneiderin, as they call them over
there, and ran a fairly big business in the Praguer Strasse.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
always been told that German husbands are the worst going, treating
their wives like slaves, or, at the best, as mere upper servants.&nbsp;
But my experience is that human nature don&rsquo;t alter so much according
to distance from London as we fancy it does, and that husbands have
their troubles same as wives all the world over.&nbsp; Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve
come across a German husband or two as didn&rsquo;t carry about with
him any sign of the slave driver such as you might notice, at all events
not in his own house; and I <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>know
for a fact that Meister Anton, which was the name of the chap I&rsquo;m
telling you about, couldn&rsquo;t have been much worse off, not even
if he&rsquo;d been an Englishman born and bred.&nbsp; There were no
children to occupy her mind, so she just devoted herself to him and
the work-girls, and made things hum, as they say in America, for all
of them.&nbsp; As for the girls, they got away at six in the evening,
and not many of them stopped more than the first month.&nbsp; But the
old man, not being able to give notice, had to put up with an average
of eighteen hours a day of it.&nbsp; And even when, as was sometimes
the case, he managed to get away for an hour or two in the evening for
a quiet talk with a few of us over a glass of beer, he could never be
quite happy, thinking of what was accumulating for him at home.&nbsp;
Of course <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>everybody
as knew him knew of his troubles&mdash;for a scolding wife ain&rsquo;t
the sort of thing as can be hid under a bushel,&mdash;and was sorry
for him, he being as amiable and good-tempered a fellow as ever lived,
and most of us spent our time with him advising him for his good.&nbsp;
Some of the more ardent would give him recipes for managing her, but
they, being generally speaking bachelors, their suggestions lacked practicability,
as you might say.&nbsp; One man bored his life out persuading him to
try a bucket of cold water.&nbsp; He was one of those cold-water enthusiasts,
this fellow; took it himself for everything, and always went to a hydropathic
establishment for his holidays.&nbsp; Rumour had it that Meister Anton
really did try this experiment on one unfortunate occasion&mdash;worried
into it, I suppose, by the other chap&rsquo;s persistency.&nbsp; <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Anyhow,
we didn&rsquo;t see him again for a week, he being confined to his bed
with a chill on the liver.&nbsp; And the next suggestion made to him
he rejected quite huffily, explaining that he had no intention of putting
any fresh ideas into his wife&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t a bad woman, mind you&mdash;merely given
to fits of temper.&nbsp; At times she could be quite pleasant: but when
she wasn&rsquo;t life with her must have been exciting.&nbsp; He had
stood it for about seven years; and then one day, without a word of
warning to anyone, he went away and left her.&nbsp; As she was quite
able to keep herself, this seemed to be the best arrangement possible,
and everybody wondered why he had never thought of it before, I did
not see him again for nine months, until I ran against him by pure chance
on <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the
K&ouml;ln platform, where I was waiting for a train to Paris.&nbsp;
He told me they had made up all their differences by correspondence,
and that he was then on his way back to her.&nbsp; He seemed quite cheerful
and expectant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s really reformed?&rsquo; I
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think nine months is long enough to have taught
her a lesson?&rsquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to damp him, but personally
I have never known but one case of a woman being cured of nagging, and
that being brought about by a fall from a third-story window, resulting
in what the doctors called permanent paralysis of the vocal organs,
can hardly be taken as a precedent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answers, &lsquo;nor nine years.&nbsp;
But it&rsquo;s been long enough to teach me a lesson.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;You
know me,&rsquo; he goes on.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t a quarrelsome
sort of chap.&nbsp; If nobody says a word to me, I never says a word
to anybody; and it&rsquo;s been like that ever since I left her, day
in and day out, all just the same.&nbsp; Up in the morning, do your
bit of work, drink your glass of beer, and to bed in the evening; nothing
to excite you, nothing to rouse you.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s a mere animal
existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a rum sort of chap, always thought things out from
his own point of view as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a curious case,&rdquo; I remarked to Henry; &ldquo;not
the sort of story to put about, however.&nbsp; It might give women the
idea that nagging is attractive, and encourage them to try it upon husbands
who do not care for that kind of excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>&ldquo;Not
much fear of that,&rdquo; replied Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;The nagging woman
is born, as they say, not made; and she&rsquo;ll nag like the roses
bloom, not because she wants to, but because she can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp;
And a woman to whom it don&rsquo;t come natural will never be any real
good at it, try as she may.&nbsp; And as for the men, why we&rsquo;ll
just go on selecting wives according to the old rule, so that you never
know what you&rsquo;ve got till it&rsquo;s too late for you to do anything
but make the best or the worst of it, according as your fancy takes
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a fellow,&rdquo; continued Henry, &ldquo;as used
to work with me a good many years ago now at a small hotel in the City.&nbsp;
He was a waiter, like myself&mdash;not a bad sort of chap, though a
bit of a toff in his off-hours.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d been engaged for some
two or three years to one of the <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>chambermaids.&nbsp;
A pretty, gentle-looking little thing she was, with big childish eyes,
and a voice like the pouring out of water.&nbsp; They are strange things,
women; one can never tell what they are made of from the taste of them.&nbsp;
And while I was there, it having been a good season for both of them,
they thought they&rsquo;d risk it and get married.&nbsp; They did the
sensible thing, he coming back to his work after the week&rsquo;s holiday,
and she to hers; the only difference being that they took a couple of
rooms of their own in Middleton Row, from where in summer-time you can
catch the glimpse of a green tree or two, and slept out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first few months they were as happy as a couple in a play,
she thinking almost as much of him as he thought of himself, which must
have been a comfort <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>to
both of them, and he as proud of her as if he made her himself.&nbsp;
And then some fifteenth cousin or so of his, a man he had never heard
of before, died in New Zealand and left him a fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the beginning of his troubles, and hers too.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t say it was enough to buy a peerage, but to a man accustomed
to dream of half-crown tips it seemed an enormous fortune.&nbsp; Anyhow,
it was sufficient to turn his head and give him ideas above his station.&nbsp;
His first move, of course, was to chuck his berth and set fire to his
dress suit, which, being tolerably greasy, burned well.&nbsp; Had he
stopped there nobody could have blamed him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often thought
myself that I would willingly give ten years of my life, provided anybody
wanted them, which I don&rsquo;t see how they should, to put my own
behind the fire.&nbsp; <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>But
he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He took a house in a mews, with the front door
in a street off Grosvenor Square, furnished it like a second-class German
restaurant, dressed himself like a bookmaker, and fancied that with
the help of a few shady City chaps and a broken-down swell or two he
had gathered round him, he was fairly on the road to Park Lane and the
House of Lords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the only thing that struck him as being at all in his
way was his wife.&nbsp; In her cap and apron, or her Sunday print she
had always looked as dainty and fetching a little piece of goods as
a man could wish to be seen out with.&nbsp; Dressed according to the
advice of his new-found friends, of course she looked like nothing else
so much as a barn-yard chicken in turkey-cock&rsquo;s feathers.&nbsp;
He was shocked to find that her size in gloves <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>was
seven-and-a-quarter, and in boots something over four, and that sort
of thing naturally irritates a woman more even than finding fault with
her immortal soul.&nbsp; I guess for about a year he made her life pretty
well a burden for her, trying to bring her up to the standard of the
Saturday-to-Monday-at-Brighton set with which he had surrounded himself,
or which, to speak more correctly, had got round him.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
a precious sight more gumption than he had ever possessed, and if he
had listened to her instead of insisting upon her listening to him it
would have been better for him.&nbsp; But there are some men who think
that if you have a taste for champagne and the ballet that proves you
are intended by nature for a nob, and he was one of them; and any common-sense
suggestion of hers only convinced <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>him
of her natural unfitness for an exalted station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He grumbled at her accent, which, seeing that his own was
acquired in Lime-house and finished off in the Minories, was just the
sort of thing a fool would do.&nbsp; And he insisted on her reading
all the society novels as they came out&mdash;you know the sort I mean,&mdash;where
everybody snaps everybody else&rsquo;s head off, and all the proverbs
are upside down; people leave them about the hotels when they&rsquo;ve
done with them, and one gets into the habit of dipping into them when
one&rsquo;s nothing better to do.&nbsp; His hope was that she might,
with pains, get to talk like these books.&nbsp; That was his ideal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did her best, but of course the more she got away from
herself the more absurd she became; and the rubbish and <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>worse
that he had about him would ridicule her more or less openly.&nbsp;
And he, instead of kicking them out into the mews&mdash;which could
have been done easily without Grosvenor Square knowing anything about
it, and thereby having its high-class feelings hurt&mdash;he would blame
her when they had all gone, just as if it was her fault that she was
the daughter of a respectable bootmaker in the Mile End Road instead
of something more likely than not turned out of the third row of the
ballet because it couldn&rsquo;t dance, and didn&rsquo;t want to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He played a bit in the City, and won at first, and that swelled
his head worse than ever.&nbsp; It also brought him a good deal of sympathy
from an Italian Countess, the sort you find at Homburg, and that generally
speaking is a widow.&nbsp; Her chief sorrow was for society&mdash;that
in him was losing an <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>ornament.&nbsp;
She explained to him how an accomplished and experienced woman could
help a man to gain admittance into the tiptop circles, which, according
to her, were just thirsting for him.&nbsp; As a waiter, he had his share
of brains, and it&rsquo;s a business that requires more insight than
perhaps you&rsquo;d fancy, if you don&rsquo;t want to waste your time
on a rabbit-skin coat and a paste ring, and give the burnt sole to the
real gent.&nbsp; But in the hands of this swell mob he was, of course,
just the young man from the country; and the end of it was that he played
the game down pretty low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;not the Countess, I shouldn&rsquo;t like you to
have that idea, but his wife&mdash;came to be pretty friendly with my
missus later on, and that&rsquo;s how I got to know the details.&nbsp;
He comes to her one day looking pretty sheepish-like, as one can well
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>believe,
and maybe he&rsquo;d been drinking a bit to give himself courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t been getting along too well together
of late, have we, Susan?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t seen much of one another,&rsquo; she
answers; &lsquo;but I agree with you, we don&rsquo;t seem to enjoy it
much when we do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t your fault,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think that,&rsquo; she answers;
&lsquo;it shows me you ain&rsquo;t quite as foolish as I was beginning
to think you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course, I didn&rsquo;t know when I married you,&rsquo;
he goes on, &lsquo;as I was going to come into this money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, nor I either,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;or you bet
it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It seems to have been a bit of a mistake,&rsquo; says
he, &lsquo;as things have turned out.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;It
would have been a mistake, and more than a bit of a one in any case,&rsquo;
answers she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you agree with me,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;there&rsquo;ll
be no need to quarrel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve always tried to agree with you,&rsquo; says
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve never quarrelled yet, and that ought to
be sufficient proof to you that we never shall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake that can be rectified,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;if you are sensible, and that without any harm to anyone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;it must be a new sort of
mistake, that kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re not fitted for one another,&rsquo; says
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Out with it,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
you be afraid of my feelings; they are well under control, as I think
I can fairly say by this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;With
a man in your own station of life,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d
be happier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s many a man I might have been happier
with,&rsquo; replies she.&nbsp; &lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t the thing to
be discussed, seeing as I&rsquo;ve got you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You might get rid of me,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You mean you might get rid of me,&rsquo; she answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It comes to the same thing,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, it don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she replies, &lsquo;nor
anything like it.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t have got rid of you for my
pleasure, and I&rsquo;m not going to do it for yours.&nbsp; You can
live like a decent man, and I&rsquo;ll go on putting up with you; or
you can live like a fool, and I shan&rsquo;t stand in your way.&nbsp;
But you can&rsquo;t do both, and I&rsquo;m not going to help you try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he argued with her, and he tried the coaxing dodge,
and he tried the <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>bullying
dodge, but it didn&rsquo;t work, neither of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done my duty by you,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;so
far as I&rsquo;ve been able, and that I&rsquo;ll go on doing or not,
just as you please; but I don&rsquo;t do more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go on living like this,&rsquo; says
he, &lsquo;and it isn&rsquo;t fair to ask me to.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
hammering my prospects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do that,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You take your proper position in society, whatever that may be,
and I&rsquo;ll take mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be glad enough to get back
to it, you may rest assured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough,&rsquo; she answers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was earning my living before I married you, and I can earn
it again.&nbsp; You go your way, I go mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t satisfy him; but there was <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>nothing
else to be done, and there was no moving her now in any other direction
whatever, even had he wanted to.&nbsp; He offered her anything in the
way of money&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t a mean chap,&mdash;but she wouldn&rsquo;t
touch a penny.&nbsp; She had kept her old clothes&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
sure that some idea of needing them hadn&rsquo;t always been in her
head,&mdash;applied for a place under her former manager, who was then
bossing a hotel in Kensington, and got it.&nbsp; And there was an end
of high life so far as she was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for him, he went the usual way.&nbsp; It always seems to
me as if men and women were just like water; sooner or later they get
back to the level from which they started&mdash;that is, of course,
generally speaking.&nbsp; Here and there a drop clings where it climbs;
but, taking them <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>on
the whole, pumping-up is a slow business.&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; I have seen
them, many of them, jolly clever they&rsquo;ve thought themselves, with
their diamond rings and big cigars.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ve always said to myself, &lsquo;there&rsquo;ll come a day when
you&rsquo;ll walk in and be glad enough of your chop and potatoes again
with your half-pint of bitter.&rsquo;&nbsp; And nine cases out of ten
I&rsquo;ve been right.&nbsp; James Wrench followed the course of the
majority, only a little more so: tried to do others a precious sight
sharper than himself, and got done; tried a dozen times to scramble
up again, each time coming down heavier than before, till there wasn&rsquo;t
another spring left in him, and his only ambition victuals.&nbsp; Then,
of course, he thought of his wife&mdash;it&rsquo;s a wonderful domesticator,
ill luck&mdash;and wondered what she was doing.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>&ldquo;Fortunately
for him, she&rsquo;d been doing well.&nbsp; Her father died and left
her a bit, just a couple of hundred or so, and with this and her own
savings she started with a small inn in a growing town, and had sold
out again three years later at four times what she had paid for it.&nbsp;
She had done even better than that for herself.&nbsp; She had developed
a talent for cooking&mdash;that was a settled income in itself,&mdash;and
at this time was running a small hotel in Brighton, and making it pay
to a tune that would have made the shareholders of some of its bigger
rivals a bit envious could they have known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to me, having found out, I don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;necessity
smartens the wits, I suppose,&mdash;that my missis still kept up a sort
of friendship with her, and begged me to try and arrange a meeting <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>between
them, which I did, though I told him frankly that from what I knew his
welcome wouldn&rsquo;t be much more enthusiastic than what he&rsquo;d
any right to expect.&nbsp; But he was always of a sanguine disposition;
and borrowing his fare and an old greatcoat of mine, he started off,
evidently thinking that all his troubles were over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they weren&rsquo;t exactly.&nbsp; The Married Women&rsquo;s
Property Act had altered things a bit, and Master James found himself
greeted without any suggestion of tenderness by a business-like woman
of thirty-six or thereabouts, and told to wait in the room behind the
bar till she could find time to talk to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She kept him waiting there for three-quarters of an hour,
just sufficient time to take the side out of him; and then <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>she
walks in and closes the door behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d say you hadn&rsquo;t changed hardly a day,
Susan,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t that you&rsquo;d grown
handsomer than ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;d been turning that over in his mind during
the three-quarters of an hour.&nbsp; It was his fancy that he knew a
bit about women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Mrs. Wrench,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;and
if you take your hat off and stand up while I&rsquo;m talking to you
it will be more what I&rsquo;m accustomed to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that staggered him a bit; but there didn&rsquo;t seem
anything else to be done, so he just made as if he thought it funny,
though I doubt if at the time he saw the full humour of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now, what do you want?&rdquo; says she, seating
herself in front of her desk, <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>and
leaving him standing, first on one leg and then on the other, twiddling
his hat in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a bad husband to you, Susan,&rsquo;
begins he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I could have told you that,&rsquo; she answers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What I asked you was what you wanted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want for us to let bygones be bygones,&rsquo; says
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s quite my own idea,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and
if you don&rsquo;t allude to the past, I shan&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re an angel, Susan,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you once,&rsquo; answers she, &lsquo;that
my name&rsquo;s Mrs. Wrench.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Susan to my friends, not
to every broken-down tramp looking for a job.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t I your husband?&rsquo; says he, trying
a bit of dignity.</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>&ldquo;She
got up and took a glance through the glass-door to see that nobody was
there to overhear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For the first and last time,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;let
you and me understand one another.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been eleven years
without a husband, and I&rsquo;ve got used to it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
feel now as I want one of any kind, and if I did it wouldn&rsquo;t be
your sort.&nbsp; Eleven years ago I wasn&rsquo;t good enough for you,
and now you&rsquo;re not good enough for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to reform,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to see you do it,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give me a chance,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s
going to be my experiment this time, not yours.&nbsp; Eleven years ago
I didn&rsquo;t give you satisfaction, so you turned me out of doors.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;You
went, Susan,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;you know it was your own idea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remind me too much of the circumstances,&rsquo;
replies she, turning on him with a look in her eyes that was probably
new to him, &lsquo;I went because there wasn&rsquo;t room for two of
us; you know that.&nbsp; The other kind suited you better.&nbsp; Now
I&rsquo;m going to see whether you suit me,&rsquo; and she sits herself
again in her landlady&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In what way?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the way of earning your living,&rsquo; says she,
&lsquo;and starting on the road to becoming a decent member of society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stood for a while cogitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rsquo; says he at last, &lsquo;as
I could manage this hotel for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m doing that
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;What
about looking to the financial side of things,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and
keeping the accounts?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hardly your work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nor yours either,&rsquo; answers she drily, &lsquo;judging
by the way you&rsquo;ve been keeping your own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like me to be head-waiter, I suppose?&rsquo;
says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be a bit of a come-down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of the hotel, I suppose,&rsquo;
says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps you are right.&nbsp; My customers are
mostly an old-fashioned class; it&rsquo;s probable enough they might
not like you.&nbsp; You had better suggest something else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I could hardly be an under-waiter,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps not,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;your manners strike
me as a bit too familiar for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>&ldquo;Then
he thought he&rsquo;d try sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d fancy my being the boots,&rsquo;
says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s more reasonable,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do much harm there, and I could keep an eye
on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You really mean that?&rsquo; says he, starting to put
on his dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she cut him short by ringing the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you think you can do better for yourself,&rsquo;
she says, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s an end of it.&nbsp; By a curious coincidence
the place is just now vacant.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep it open for you
till to-morrow night; you can turn it over in your mind.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And one of the page boys coming in she just says &lsquo;Good-morning,&rsquo;
and the interview was at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he turned it over, and he took the job.&nbsp; He thought
she&rsquo;d relent after the <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>first
week or two, but she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He just kept that place for
over fifteen months, and learnt the business.&nbsp; In the house he
was James the boots, and she Mrs. Wrench the landlady, and she saw to
it that he didn&rsquo;t forget it.&nbsp; He had his wages and he made
his tips, and the food was plentiful; but I take it he worked harder
during that time than he&rsquo;d ever worked before in his life, and
found that a landlady is just twice as difficult to please as the strictest
landlord it can be a man&rsquo;s misfortune to get under, and that Mrs.
Wrench was no exception to the rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of the fifteen months she sends for him into the
office.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t want telling by this time; he just stood
with his hat in his hand and waited respectful like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;James,&rsquo; says she, after she had finished <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>what
she was doing, &lsquo;I find I shall want another waiter for the coffee-room
this season.&nbsp; Would you care to try the place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, Mrs. Wrench,&rsquo; he answers; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
more what I&rsquo;ve been used to, and I think I&rsquo;ll be able to
give satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no wages attached, as I suppose you know,&rsquo;
continues she; &lsquo;but the second floor goes with it, and if you
know your business you ought to make from twenty-five to thirty shillings
a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Wrench; that&rsquo;ll suit me very well,&rsquo;
replies he; and it was settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did better as a waiter; he&rsquo;d got it in his blood,
as you might say; and so after a time he worked up to be head-waiter.&nbsp;
Now and then, of course, it came about that he found himself waiting
on <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the
very folks that he&rsquo;d been chums with in his classy days, and that
must have been a bit rough on him.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;d taken in a good
deal of sense since then; and when one of the old sort, all rings and
shirt-front, dining there one Sunday evening, started chaffing him,
Jimmy just shut him up with a quiet: &lsquo;Yes, I guess we were both
a bit out of our place in those days.&nbsp; The difference between us
now is that I have got back to mine,&rsquo; which cost him his tip,
but must nave been a satisfaction to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether he worked in that hotel for some three and a half
years, and then Mrs. Wrench sends for him again into the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sit down, James,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, Mrs. Wrench,&rsquo; says James, and sat.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m
thinking of giving up this hotel, James,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and
taking another near Dover, a quiet place with just such a clientele
as I shall like.&nbsp; Do you care to come with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m thinking,
Mrs. Wrench, of making a change myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear
that, James.&nbsp; I thought we&rsquo;d been getting on very well together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to do my best, Mrs. Wrench,&rsquo;

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to complain of, James,&rsquo; says
she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thank you for saying it,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and
I thank you for the opportunity you gave me when I wanted it.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s been the making of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>&ldquo;She
didn&rsquo;t answer for about a minute.&nbsp; Then says she: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
been meeting some of your old friends, James, I&rsquo;m afraid, and
they&rsquo;ve been persuading you to go back into the City.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Mrs. Wrench,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;no more City
for me, and no more neighbourhood of Grosvenor Square, unless it be
in the way of business; and that couldn&rsquo;t be, of course, for a
good long while to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean by business?&rsquo; asks she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The hotel business,&rsquo; replies he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
believe I know the bearings by now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve saved a bit, thanks
to you, Mrs. Wrench, and a bit&rsquo;s come in from the wreck that I
never hoped for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Enough to start you?&rsquo; asks she.</p>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not
quite enough for that,&rsquo; answers he.&nbsp; &lsquo;My idea is a
small partnership.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How much is it altogether?&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;if
it&rsquo;s not an impertinent question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; answers he.&nbsp; &lsquo;It tots
up to &pound;900 about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She turns back to her desk and goes on with her writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dover wouldn&rsquo;t suit you, I suppose?&rsquo; says
she without looking round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dover&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;if
the business is a good one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It can be worked up into one of the best things going,&rsquo;
says she, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m getting it dirt cheap.&nbsp; You can
have a third share for a thousand pounds, that&rsquo;s just what it&rsquo;s
costing, and owe me the other hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what position do I take?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If
you come in on those terms,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;then, of course,
it&rsquo;s a partnership.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rose and came over to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Life isn&rsquo;t
all business, Susan,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found it so mostly,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fourteen years ago,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I made the
mistake; now you&rsquo;re making it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What mistake am I making?&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That man&rsquo;s the only thing as can&rsquo;t learn
a lesson,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and what&rsquo;s the lesson
that you&rsquo;ve learnt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That I never get on without you, Susan,&rsquo; says
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;you suggested a partnership,
and I agreed to it.&nbsp; What more do you want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to know the name of the firm,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr.
and Mrs. Wrench,&rsquo; says she, turning round to him and holding out
her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;How will that suit you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do me all right,&rsquo; answers he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll try and give satisfaction,&rsquo; adds he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe you,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in that way they made a fresh start, as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>THE
WOOING OF TOM SLEIGHT&rsquo;S WIFE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s competition,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;that
makes the world go round.&nbsp; You never want a thing particularly
until you see another fellow trying to get it; then it strikes you all
of a sudden that you&rsquo;ve a better right to it than he has.&nbsp;
Take barmaids: what&rsquo;s the attraction about &rsquo;em?&nbsp; In
looks they&rsquo;re no better than the average girl in the street; while
as for their temper, well that&rsquo;s a bit above the average&mdash;leastways,
so far as my experience goes.&nbsp; Yet the thinnest of &rsquo;em has
her dozen, making sheep&rsquo;s-eyes at her across the counter.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve known girls that on the <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>level
couldn&rsquo;t have got a policeman to look at &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Put
&rsquo;em behind a row of tumblers and a shilling&rsquo;s-worth of stale
pastry, and nothing outside a Lincoln and Bennett is good enough for
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the competition that&rsquo;s the making
of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you a story,&rdquo; continued Henry,
&ldquo;that bears upon the subject.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pretty story,
if you look at it from one point of view; though my wife maintains&mdash;and
she&rsquo;s a bit of a judge, mind you&mdash;that it&rsquo;s not yet
finished, she arguing that there&rsquo;s a difference between marrying
and being married.&nbsp; You can have a fancy for the one, without caring
much about the other.&nbsp; What I tell her is that a boy isn&rsquo;t
a man, and a man isn&rsquo;t a boy.&nbsp; Besides, it&rsquo;s five years
ago now, and nothing has happened since: though of course one can never
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>&ldquo;I
would like to hear the story,&rdquo; I ventured to suggest; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be able to judge better afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a long one,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;though
as a matter of fact it began seventeen years ago in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire.&nbsp; He was a wild young fellow, and always had been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Sleight,&rdquo; answered Henry, &ldquo;the chap I&rsquo;m
telling you about.&nbsp; He belonged to a good family, his father being
a Magistrate for Monmouthshire; but there had been no doing anything
with young Tom from the very first.&nbsp; At fifteen he ran away from
school at Clifton, and with everything belonging to him tied up in a
pocket-handkerchief made his way to Bristol Docks.&nbsp; There he shipped
as boy on board an American schooner, the <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Cap&rsquo;n
not pressing for any particulars, being short-handed, and the boy himself
not volunteering much.&nbsp; Whether his folks made much of an effort
to get him back, or whether they didn&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t tell you.&nbsp;
Maybe, they thought a little roughing it would knock some sense into
him.&nbsp; Anyhow, the fact remains that for the next seven or eight
years, until the sudden death of his father made him a country gentleman,
a more or less jolly sailor-man he continued to be.&nbsp; And it was
during that period&mdash;to be exact, three years after he ran away
and four years before he returned&mdash;that, as I have said, at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, he married, after ten days&rsquo; courtship, Mary Godselle,
only daughter of Jean Godselle, saloon keeper of that town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes him just eighteen,&rdquo; I <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>remarked;
&ldquo;somewhat young for a bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a good deal older than the bride,&rdquo; was Henry&rsquo;s
comment, &ldquo;she being at the time a few months over fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it legal?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite legal,&rdquo; answered Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;In New Hampshire,
it would seem, they encourage early marriages.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t
begin a good thing too soon,&rsquo; is, I suppose, their motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the marriage turn out?&rdquo; was my next question.&nbsp;
The married life of a lady and gentleman, the united ages of whom amounted
to thirty-two, promised interesting developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically speaking,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t
a marriage at all.&nbsp; It had been a secret affair from the beginning,
as perhaps you can imagine.&nbsp; The old man <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>had
other ideas for his daughter, and wasn&rsquo;t the sort of father to
be played with.&nbsp; They separated at the church door, intending to
meet again in the evening.&nbsp; Two hours later Master Tom Sleight
got knocked on the head in a street brawl.&nbsp; If a row was to be
had anywhere within walking distance he was the sort of fellow to be
in it.&nbsp; When he came to his senses he found himself lying in his
bunk, and the &lsquo;Susan Pride&rsquo;&mdash;if that was the name of
the ship; I think it was&mdash;ten miles out to sea.&nbsp; The Captain
declined to put the vessel about to please either a loving seaman or
a loving seaman&rsquo;s wife; and to come to the point, the next time
Mr. Tom Sleight saw Mrs. Tom Sleight was seven years later at the American
bar of the Grand Central in Paris; and then he didn&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>&ldquo;But
what had she been doing all the time?&rdquo; I queried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you mean to tell me that she, a married woman, had been content to let
her husband disappear without making any attempt to trace him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was making it short,&rdquo; retorted Henry, in an injured
tone, &ldquo;for your benefit; if you want to have the whole of it,
of course you can.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t a scamp; he was just a scatterbrain&mdash;that
was the worst you could say against him.&nbsp; He tried to communicate
with her, but never got an answer.&nbsp; Then he wrote to the father,
and told him frankly the whole story.&nbsp; The letter came back six
months later, marked&mdash;&lsquo;Gone away; left no address.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You see, what had happened was this: the old man died suddenly a month
or two after the marriage, without <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>ever
having heard a word about it.&nbsp; The girl hadn&rsquo;t a relative
or friend in the town, all her folks being French Canadians.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
got her pride, and she&rsquo;d got a sense of humour not common in a
woman.&nbsp; I was with her at the Grand Central for over a year, and
came to know her pretty well.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t choose to advertise
the fact that her husband had run away from her, as she thought, an
hour after he had married her.&nbsp; She knew he was a gentleman with
rich relatives somewhere in England; and as the months went by without
bringing word or sign of him, she concluded he&rsquo;d thought the matter
over and was ashamed of her.&nbsp; You must remember she was merely
a child at the time, and hardly understood her position.&nbsp; Maybe
later on she would have seen the necessity of doing something.&nbsp;
<!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>But
Chance, as it were, saved her the trouble; for she had not been serving
in the Caf&eacute; more than a month when, early one afternoon, in walked
her Lord and Master.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mam&rsquo;sell Marie,&rsquo; as of
course we called her over there, was at that moment busy talking to
two customers, while smiling at a third; and our hero, he gave a start
the moment he set eyes on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me that when he saw her there he didn&rsquo;t know
her,&rdquo; I reminded Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, sir,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;so I did; but
he knew a pretty girl when he saw one anywhere at any time&mdash;he
was that sort, and a prettier, saucier looking young personage than
Marie, in spite of her misfortunes, as I suppose you&rsquo;d call &rsquo;em,
you wouldn&rsquo;t have found <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>had
you searched Paris from the Place de la Bastille to the Arc de Triomphe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;know him, or was the forgetfulness
mutual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She recognised him,&rdquo; returned Henry, &ldquo;before he
entered the Caf&eacute;, owing to catching sight of his face through
the glass door while he was trying to find the handle.&nbsp; Women on
some points have better memories than men.&nbsp; Added to which, when
you come to think of it, the game was a bit one-sided.&nbsp; Except
that his moustache, maybe, was a little more imposing, and that he wore
the clothes of a gentleman in place of those of an able-bodied seaman
before the mast, he was to all intents and purposes the same as when
they parted six years ago outside the church door; while she had changed
from a child in a short muslin frock and <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>a
&lsquo;flapper,&rsquo; as I believe they call it, tied up in blue ribbon,
to a self-possessed young woman in a frock that might have come out
of a Bond Street show window, and a Japanese coiffure, that being then
the fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She finished with her French customers, not hurrying herself
in the least&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t her way; and then strolling over
to her husband, asked him in French what she could have the pleasure
of doing for him.&nbsp; His education on board the &lsquo;Susan Pride&rsquo;
and others had, I take it, gone back rather than forward.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
understand her, so she translated it for him into broken English, with
an accent.&nbsp; He asked her how she knew he was English.&nbsp; She
told him it was because Englishmen had such pretty moustaches, and came
back with his order, which was <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>rum
punch.&nbsp; She kept him waiting about a quarter of an hour before
she returned with it.&nbsp; He filled up the time looking into the glass
behind him when he thought nobody was observing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One American drink, as they used to concoct it in that bar,
was generally enough for most of our customers, but he, before he left,
contrived to put away three; also contriving, during the same short
space of time, to inform &lsquo;Mam&rsquo;sel Marie&rsquo; that Paris,
since he had looked into her eyes, had become the only town worth living
in, so far as he was concerned, throughout the whole universe.&nbsp;
He had his failings, had Master Tom Sleight, but shyness wasn&rsquo;t
one of them.&nbsp; She gave him a smile when he left that would have
brought a less impressionable young man than he back <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>again
to that Caf&eacute;; but for the rest of the day I noticed &lsquo;Mam&rsquo;sel
Marie&rsquo; frowned to herself a good deal, and was quite unusually
cynical in her view of things in general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next afternoon he found his way to us again, and much the
same sort of thing went on, only a little more of it.&nbsp; A sailor-man,
so I am told, makes love with his hour of departure always before his
mind, and so gets into the habit of not wasting time.&nbsp; He gave
her short lessons in English, for which she appeared to be grateful,
and she at his request taught him the French for &lsquo;You are just
charming!&nbsp; I love you!&rsquo; with which, so he explained, it was
his intention, on his return to England, to surprise his mother.&nbsp;
He turned up again after dinner, and the next day before lunch, when
after that I <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>looked
up and missed him at his usual table, the feeling would come to me that
business was going down.&nbsp; Marie always appeared delighted to see
him, and pouted when he left; but what puzzled me at the time was, that
though she fooled him to the top of his bent, she flirted every bit
as much, if not more, with her other customers&mdash;leastways with
the nicer ones among them.&nbsp; There was one young Frenchman in particular&mdash;a
good-looking chap, a Monsieur Flammard, son of the painter.&nbsp; Up
till then he&rsquo;d been making love pretty steadily to Miss Marie,
as, indeed, had most of &rsquo;em, without ever getting much forrarder;
for hitherto a chat about the weather, and a smile that might have meant
she was in love with you or might have meant she was laughing at you&mdash;no
man could ever tell which,&mdash;<!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>was
all the most persistent had got out of her.&nbsp; Now, however, and
evidently to his own surprise, young Monsieur Flammard found himself
in clover.&nbsp; Provided his English rival happened to be present and
not too far removed, he could have as much flirtation as he wanted,
which, you may take it, worked out at a very tolerable amount.&nbsp;
Master Tom could sit and scowl, and for the matter of that did; but
as Marie would explain to him, always with the sweetest of smiles, her
business was to be nice to all her customers, and to this, of course,
he had nothing to reply: that he couldn&rsquo;t understand a word of
what she and Flammard talked and laughed about didn&rsquo;t seem to
make him any the happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this sort of thing went on for perhaps a fortnight,
and then one morning <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>over
our d&eacute;jeun&eacute;, when she and I had the Caf&eacute; entirely
to ourselves, I took the opportunity of talking to Mam&rsquo;sel Marie
like a father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She heard me out without a murmur, which showed her sense;
for liking the girl sincerely, I didn&rsquo;t mince matters with her,
but spoke plainly for her good.&nbsp; The result was, she told me her
story much as I have told it to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a funny tale,&rsquo; says I when she&rsquo;d
finished, &lsquo;though maybe you yourself don&rsquo;t see the humour
of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo; was her answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
there&rsquo;s a serious side to it also,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and
that interests me more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re not making a mistake?&rsquo;
I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s been in my thoughts too much for me to forget
him,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>&lsquo;Besides,
he&rsquo;s told me his name and all about himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not quite all,&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, and that&rsquo;s why I feel hard toward him,&rsquo;
answers she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now you listen to me,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
is a very pretty comedy, and the way you&rsquo;ve played it does you
credit up till now.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you run it on too long, and turn
it into a problem play.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye mean?&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A man&rsquo;s a man,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;anyhow he&rsquo;s
one.&nbsp; He fell in love with you six years ago when you were only
a child, and now you&rsquo;re a woman he&rsquo;s fallen in love with
you again.&nbsp; If that don&rsquo;t convince you of his constancy,
nothing will.&nbsp; You stop there.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you try to find
out any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I mean to find out one thing, <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>answers
she: &lsquo;whether he&rsquo;s a man&mdash;or a cad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a severe remark,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to
make about your own husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What am I to think?&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
fooled me into loving him when, as you say, I was only a child.&nbsp;
Do you think I haven&rsquo;t suffered all these years?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the girl that cries her eyes out for her lover; we learn to take &rsquo;em
for what they&rsquo;re worth later on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he&rsquo;s in love with you still,&rsquo; I says.&nbsp;
I knew what was in her mind, but I wanted to lead her away from it if
I could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and you
know it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t choosing her words; she was feeling,
if you understand.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s in love with a pretty waitress
that he met for the first time a fortnight ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s
because she reminds him of you,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;or because
you remind him of her, whichever you prefer.&nbsp; It shows you&rsquo;re
the sort of woman he&rsquo;ll always be falling in love with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She laughed at that, but the next moment she was serious again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A man&rsquo;s got to fall out of love before he falls into it
again,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want a man that&rsquo;ll stop
there.&nbsp; Besides,&rsquo; she goes on, &lsquo;a woman isn&rsquo;t
always young and pretty: we&rsquo;ve got to remember that.&nbsp; We
want something else in a husband besides eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You seem to know a lot about it,&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about it,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What sort of husband do you want?&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want a man of honour,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>&ldquo;That
was sense.&nbsp; One don&rsquo;t often find a girl her age talking it,
but her life had made her older than she looked.&nbsp; All I could find
to say was that he appeared to be an honest chap, and maybe was one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what I
mean to find out.&nbsp; And if you&rsquo;ll do me a kindness,&rsquo;
she adds, &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t mind calling me Marie Luthier for the
future, instead of Godselle.&nbsp; It was my mother&rsquo;s name, and
I&rsquo;ve a fancy for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there I left her to work out the thing for herself,
having come to the conclusion she was capable of doing it; and so for
another couple of weeks I merely watched.&nbsp; There was no doubt about
his being in love with her.&nbsp; He had entered that Caf&eacute; at
the beginning of the month with as good an opinion of himself as a <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>man
can conveniently carry without tumbling down and falling over it.&nbsp;
Before the month was out he would sit with his head between his hands,
evidently wondering why he had been born.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen the
game played before, and I&rsquo;ve seen it played since.&nbsp; A waiter
has plenty of opportunities if he only makes use of them; for if it
comes to a matter of figures, I suppose there&rsquo;s more love-making
done in a month under the electric light of the restaurant than the
moon sees in a year&mdash;leastways, so far as concerns what we call
the civilised world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen men fooled, from boys without
hair on their faces, to old men without much on their heads.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
seen it done in a way that was pretty to watch, and I&rsquo;ve seen
it done in a manner that has made me feel that given a wig and a petticoat
I could do it <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>better
myself.&nbsp; But never have I seen it neater played than Marie played
it on that young man of hers.&nbsp; One day she would greet him for
all the world like a tired child that at last has found its mother,
and the next day respond to him in a style calculated to give you the
idea of a small-sized empress in misfortune compelled to tolerate the
familiarities of an anarchist.&nbsp; One moment she would throw him
a pout that said as clearly as words: &lsquo;What a fool you are not
to put your arms round me and kiss me&rsquo;; and five minutes later
chill him with a laugh that as good as told him he must be blind not
to see that she was merely playing with him.&nbsp; What happened outside
the Caf&eacute;&mdash;for now and then she would let him meet her of
a morning in the Tuileries and walk down to the Caf&eacute; <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>with
her, and once or twice had allowed him to see her part of the way home&mdash;I
cannot tell you: I only know that before strangers it was her instinct
to be reserved.&nbsp; I take it that on such occasions his experiences
were interesting; but whether they left him elated or depressed I doubt
if he could have told you himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all the time Marie herself was just going from bad to
worse.&nbsp; She had come to the Caf&eacute; a light-hearted, sweet-tempered
girl; now, when she wasn&rsquo;t engaged in her play-acting&mdash;for
that&rsquo;s all it was, I could see plainly enough&mdash;she would
go about her work silent and miserable-looking, or if she spoke at all
it would be to say something bitter.&nbsp; Then one morning after a
holiday she had asked for, and which I had given her without any questions,
she came to business more like her <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>old
self than I had seen her since the afternoon Master Tom Sleight had
appeared upon the scene.&nbsp; All that day she went about smiling to
herself; and young Flammard, presuming a bit too far maybe upon past
favours, found himself sharply snubbed: it was a bit rough on him, the
whole thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s come to a head,&rsquo; says I to myself;
&lsquo;he has explained everything, and has managed to satisfy her.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a cleverer chap than I took him for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t turn up at the Caf&eacute; that day, however,
at all, and she never said a word until closing time, when she asked
me to walk part of the way home with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I says, so soon as we had reached a quieter
street, &lsquo;is the comedy over?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo;
says she, &lsquo;so far as I&rsquo;m concerned it&rsquo;s commenced.&nbsp;
To tell you the truth, it&rsquo;s been a bit too serious up to now to
please me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only just beginning to enjoy myself,&rsquo;
and she laughed, quite her old light-hearted laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You seem to be a bit more cheerful,&rsquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m feeling it,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s
not as bad as I thought.&nbsp; We went to Versailles yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pretty place, Versailles,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;paths
a bit complicated if you don&rsquo;t know your way among &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They do wind,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And there he told you that he loved you, and explained
everything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
just what happened.&nbsp; And then he kissed <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>me
for the first and last time, and now he&rsquo;s on his way to America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On his way to America?&rsquo; says I, stopping still
in the middle of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To find his wife,&rsquo; she says.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
pretty well ashamed of himself for not having tried to do it before.&nbsp;
I gave him one or two hints how to set about it&mdash;he&rsquo;s not
over smart&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got an idea he will discover her.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She dropped her joking manner, and gave my arm a little squeeze.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d have flirted with her own grandfather&mdash;that&rsquo;s
my opinion of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He was really nice,&rsquo; she continues.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
had to keep lecturing myself, or I&rsquo;d have been sorry for him.&nbsp;
He told me it was his love for me that had shown him what a wretch he
had been.&nbsp; He said he knew I didn&rsquo;t care for him two straws&mdash;<!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>and
there I didn&rsquo;t contradict him&mdash;and that he respected me all
the more for it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t explain to you how he worked it
out, but what he meant was that I was so good myself that no one but
a thoroughly good fellow could possibly have any chance with me, and
that any other sort of fellow ought to be ashamed of himself for daring
even to be in love with me, and that he couldn&rsquo;t rest until he
had proved to himself that he was worthy to have loved me, and then
he wasn&rsquo;t going to love me any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bit complicated,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose you understood it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was perfectly plain,&rsquo; says she, somewhat shortly,
&lsquo;and, as I told him, made me really like him for the first time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t occur to him to ask you <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>why
you had been flirting like a volcano with a chap you didn&rsquo;t like,&rsquo;
says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t refer to it as flirtation,&rsquo; says
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;He regarded it as kindness to a lonely man in a strange
land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think you&rsquo;ll be all right,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s all the makings of a good husband in him&mdash;seems
to be simple-minded enough, anyhow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He has a very lovable personality when you once know
him,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;All sailors are apt to be thoughtless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should try and break him of it later on,&rsquo; says
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Besides, she was a bit of a fool herself, going away
and leaving no address,&rsquo; adds she; and having reached her turning,
we said good-night to one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a month passed after that without anything happening.&nbsp;
For the first <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>week
Marie was as merry as a kitten, but as the days went by, and no sign
came, she grew restless and excited.&nbsp; Then one morning she came
into the Caf&eacute; twice as important as she had gone out the night
before, and I could see by her face that her little venture was panning
out successfully.&nbsp; She waited till we had the Caf&eacute; to ourselves,
which usually happened about mid-day, and then she took a letter out
of her pocket and showed it me.&nbsp; It was a nice respectful letter
containing sentiments that would have done honour to a churchwarden.&nbsp;
Thanks to Marie&rsquo;s suggestions, for which he could never be sufficiently
grateful, and which proved her to be as wise as she was good and beautiful,
he had traced Mrs. Sleight, n&eacute;e Mary Godselle, to Quebec.&nbsp;
From Quebec, on the death of <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>her
uncle, she had left to take a situation as waitress in a New York hotel,
and he was now on his way there to continue his search.&nbsp; The result
he would, with Miss Marie&rsquo;s permission, write and inform her.&nbsp;
If he obtained happiness he would owe it all to her.&nbsp; She it was
who had shown him his duty; there was a good deal of it, but that&rsquo;s
what it meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week later came another letter, dated from New York this
time.&nbsp; Mary could not be discovered anywhere; her situation she
had left just two years ago, but for what or for where nobody seemed
to know.&nbsp; What was to be done?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mam&rsquo;sel Marie sat down and wrote him by return of post,
and wrote him somewhat sharply&mdash;in broken English.&nbsp; It seemed
to her he must be strangely lacking <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>in
intelligence.&nbsp; Mary, as he knew, spoke French as well as she did
English.&nbsp; Such girls&mdash;especially such waitresses&mdash;he
might know, were sought after on the Continent.&nbsp; Very possibly
there were agencies in New York whose business it was to offer good
Continental engagements to such young ladies.&nbsp; Even she herself
had heard of one such&mdash;Brathwaite, in West Twenty-third Street,
or maybe Twenty-fourth.&nbsp; She signed her new name, Marie Luthier,
and added a P.S. to the effect that a right-feeling husband who couldn&rsquo;t
find his wife would have written in a tone less suggestive of resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That helped him considerably, that suggestion of Marie&rsquo;s
about the agent Brathwaite.&nbsp; A fortnight later came a third letter.&nbsp;
Wonderful to relate, his wife was actually in Paris, of all places in
the <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>world!&nbsp;
She had taken a situation in the Hotel du Louvre.&nbsp; Master Tom expected
to be in Paris almost as soon as his letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go round to the Louvre if you can
spare me for quarter of an hour,&rsquo; said Marie, &lsquo;and see the
manager.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days after, at one o&rsquo;clock precisely, Mr. Tom Sleight
walked into the Caf&eacute;.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t look cheerful and
he didn&rsquo;t look sad.&nbsp; He had been to the &lsquo;Louvre&rsquo;;
Mary Godselle had left there about a year ago; but he had obtained her
address in Paris, and had received a letter from her that very morning.&nbsp;
He showed it to Marie.&nbsp; It was short, and not well written.&nbsp;
She would meet him in the Tuileries that evening at seven, by the Diana
and the Nymph; he would know her by her wearing the onyx brooch he <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>had
given her the day before their wedding.&nbsp; She mentioned it was onyx,
in case he had forgotten.&nbsp; He only stopped a few minutes, and both
he and Marie spoke gravely and in low tones.&nbsp; He left a small case
in her hands at parting; he said he hoped she would wear it in remembrance
of one in whose thoughts she would always remain enshrined.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t tell you what he meant; I only tell you what he said.&nbsp;
He also gave me a very handsome walking-stick with a gold handle&mdash;what
for, I don&rsquo;t know; I take it he felt like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie asked to leave that evening at half-past six.&nbsp;
I never saw her looking prettier.&nbsp; She called me into the office
before she went.&nbsp; She wanted my advice.&nbsp; She had in one hand
a beautiful opal brooch set in diamonds&mdash;it was what he <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>had
given her that morning&mdash;and in her other hand the one of onyx.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall I wear them both?&rsquo; asked she, &lsquo;or
only the one?&rsquo;&nbsp; She was half laughing, half crying, already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought for a bit.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should wear the onyx to-night,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;by itself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
